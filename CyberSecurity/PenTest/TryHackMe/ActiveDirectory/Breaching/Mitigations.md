In terms of mitigations, there are some steps that organisations can take:
- *User awareness and training* - The weakest link in the cybersecurity chain is almost always users. Training users and making them aware that they should be careful about disclosing sensitive information such as credentials and not trust suspicious emails reduces this attack surface.
- *Limit the exposure of AD services and applications online* - Not all applications must be accessible from the internet, especially those that support NTLM and LDAP authentication. Instead, these applications should be placed in an intranet that can be accessed through a VPN. The VPN can then support multi-factor authentication for added security.
- *Enforce Network Access Control (NAC)* - NAC can prevent attackers from connecting rogue devices on the network. However, it will require quite a bit of effort since legitimate devices will have to be allowlisted.
- *Enforce SMB Signing* - By enforcing SMB signing, SMB relay attacks are not possible.
- *Follow the principle of least privileges* - In most cases, an attacker will be able to recover a set of AD credentials. By following the principle of least privilege, especially for credentials used for services, the risk associated with these credentials being compromised can be significantly reduced.
