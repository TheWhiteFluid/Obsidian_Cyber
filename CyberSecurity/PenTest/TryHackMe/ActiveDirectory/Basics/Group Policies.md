The main idea behind this is to be able to deploy different policies for each OU individually. That way, we can push different configurations and security baselines to users depending on their department.

Windows manages such policies through **Group Policy Objects (GPO)**. GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities.

The first thing you will see when opening it is your complete **OU** hierarchy, as defined before. To configure Group Policies, you first create a **GPO** under **Group Policy Objects** and then link it to the **OU** where you want the policies to apply:
		![[Pasted image 20240912024707.png]]
Let's examine the `Default Domain Policy` to see what's inside a GPO. The first tab you'll see when selecting a **GPO** shows its **scope**, which is where the GPO is linked in the *AD*. For the current policy, we can see that it has only been linked to the `thm.local` domain:
		![[Pasted image 20240912024756.png]]
As you can see, you can also apply **Security Filtering** to GPOs so that they are only applied to specific users/computers under an OU. By default, they will apply to the **Authenticated Users** group, which includes all users/PCs.

The **Settings** tab includes the actual contents of the GPO and lets us know what specific configurations it applies. As stated before, each GPO has configurations that apply to computers only and configurations that apply to users only. In this case, the `Default Domain Policy` only contains Computer Configurations:
		![[Pasted image 20240912024900.png]]
Since this GPO applies to the whole domain, any change to it would affect all computers. Let's change the minimum password length policy to require users to have at least 10 characters in their passwords. To do this, right-click the GPO and select **Edit**:
		![[Pasted image 20240912024920.png]]
This will open a new window where we can navigate and edit all the available configurations. To change the minimum password length, go to `Computer Configurations -> Policies -> Windows Setting -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy` and change the required policy value:

## GPO distribution
GPOs are distributed to the network via a **network share** called `SYSVOL`, which is stored in the **DC**. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to the `C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\` directory on each of the DCs in our network.

Once a change has been made to any GPOs, it might take up to 2 hours for computers to catch up. If you want to force any particular computer to sync its GPOs immediately, you can always run the following command on the desired computer:
```shell-session
PS C:\> gpupdate /force
```

### Example
As part of our new job, we have been tasked with implementing some GPOs to allow us to:
1. Block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel.
2. Make workstations and servers lock their screen automatically after 5 minutes of user inactivity to avoid people leaving their sessions exposed.

**_Restrict Access to Control Panel_**
We want to restrict access to the Control Panel across all machines to only the users that are part of the IT department. Users of other departments shouldn't be able to change the system's preferences.

Let's create a new GPO called `Restrict Control Panel Access` and open it for editing. Since we want this GPO to apply to specific users, we will look under `User Configuration` for the following policy:
		![[Pasted image 20240912025317.png]]

Notice we have enabled the **Prohibit Access to Control Panel and PC settings** policy.

Once the GPO is configured, we will need to link it to all of the OUs corresponding to users who shouldn't have access to the Control Panel of their PCs. In this case, we will link the `Marketing`, `Management` and `Sales` OUs by dragging the GPO to each of them:
		![[Pasted image 20240912025503.png]]

**_Auto Lock Screen GPO_**
For the first GPO, regarding screen locking for workstations and servers, we could directly apply it over the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs we created previously.

While this solution should work, an alternative consists of simply applying the GPO to the root domain, as we want the GPO to affect all of our computers. Since the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs are all child OUs of the root domain, they will inherit its policies.

Note: 
	Notice that if our GPO is applied to the root domain, it will also be inherited by other OUs like `Sales` or `Marketing`. Since these OUs contain users only, any Computer Configuration in our GPO will be ignored by them.

Let's create a new GPO, call it `Auto Lock Screen`, and edit it. The policy to achieve what we want is located in the following route:
		![[Pasted image 20240912025717.png]]
We will set the inactivity limit to 5 minutes so that computers get locked automatically if any user leaves their session open. After closing the GPO editor, we will link the GPO to the root domain by dragging the GPO to it:
