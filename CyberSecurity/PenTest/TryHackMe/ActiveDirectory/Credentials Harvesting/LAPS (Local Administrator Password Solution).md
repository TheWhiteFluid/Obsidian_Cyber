
## Group Policy Preferences (GPP)
A Windows OS has a built-in Administrator account which can be accessed using a password. Changing passwords in a large Windows environment with many computers is challenging. Therefore, Microsoft implemented a method to change local administrator accounts across workstations using Group Policy Preferences (GPP).

GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the SYSVOL folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an NTFS volume that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission.

The issue was the GPP relevant XML files contained a password encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN). Since Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is [Get-GPPPassword](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1).

## Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)
In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the SYSVOL folder. It introduced the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password.

The new method includes two new attributes (ms-mcs-AdmPwd and ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime) of computer objects in the Active Directory. :
-  `ms-mcs-AdmPwd` attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator;
-  `ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime` contains the expiration time to reset the password. 

LAPS uses `admpwd.dll` to change the local administrator password and update the value of `ms-mcs-AdmPwd`.

## Enumerate for LAPS
The provided VM has the LAPS enabled, so let's start enumerating it. First, we check if LAPS is installed in the target machine, which can be done by checking the `admpwd.dll` path.

Enumerating for LAPS
```shell-session
C:\Users\thm>dir "C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE"
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is A8A4-C362

 Directory of C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE

06/06/2022  01:01 PM              .
06/06/2022  01:01 PM              ..
05/05/2021  07:04 AM           184,232 AdmPwd.dll
               1 File(s)        184,232 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  10,306,015,232 bytes free
```

The output confirms that we have LAPS on the machine. Let's check the available commands to use for `AdmPwd` cmdlets as follows:

Listing the availablePowerShellcmdlets for LAPS
```shell-session
PS C:\Users\thm> Get-Command *AdmPwd*

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Cmdlet          Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights                          5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Get-AdmPwdPassword                                 5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Reset-AdmPwdPassword                               5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdAuditing                                 5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission                   5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission                   5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission                  5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
Cmdlet          Update-AdmPwdADSchema                              5.0.0.0    AdmPwd.PS
```

Next, we need to find which AD organizational unit (OU) has the "All extended rights" attribute that deals with LAPS. We will be using the "Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights" cmdlet to provide the right OU. Note that getting the available OUs could be done in the enumeration step. Our OU target in this example is `THMorg`. You can use the `-Identity *`  argument to list all available OUs.

Finding Users with AdmPwdExtendedRights Attribute
```shell-session
PS C:\Users\thm> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights -Identity THMorg

ObjectDN                                      ExtendedRightHolders
--------                                      --------------------
OU=THMorg,DC=thm,DC=red                       {THM\THMGroupReader}
```

The output shows that the `THMGroupReader` group in `THMorg` has the right access to LAPS. Let's check the group and its members.

Finding Users belong to THMGroupReader Group
```shell-session
PS C:\Users\thm> net groups "THMGroupReader"
Group name     THMGroupReader
Comment

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bk-admin
The command completed successfully.

PS C:\Users\victim> net user test-admin

                             *THMGroupReader           *Enterprise Admins
The command completed successfully.
```

## Getting the Password
We found that the `bk-admin` user is a member of `THMGroupReader`, so in order to get the LAPS password, we need to compromise or impersonate the bk-admin user. After compromising the right user, we can get the LAPS password using `Get-AdmPwdPassword` cmdlet by providing the target machine with LAPS enabled.

Getting LAPS Password with the Right User
```shell-session
PS C:\> Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName creds-harvestin

ComputerName         DistinguishedName                             Password           ExpirationTimestamp
------------         -----------------                             --------           -------------------
CREDS-HARVESTIN      CN=CREDS-HARVESTIN,OU=THMorg,DC=thm,DC=red    FakePassword    2/11/2338 11:05:2...
```

**Note:**
	It is important to note that in a real-world AD environment, the LAPS is enabled on specific machines only. Thus, you need to enumerate and find the right target computer as well as the right user account to be able to get the LAPS password. There are many scripts to help with this, but we included the [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) PowerShell script.


## Example
Follow the technique discussed in this task to get the LAPS password. What is the LAPs Password for **Creds-Harvestin** computer?
