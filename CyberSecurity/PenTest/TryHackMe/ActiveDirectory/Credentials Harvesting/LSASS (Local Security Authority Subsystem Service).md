Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) is a Windows process that handles the operating system security policy and enforces it on a system. It verifies logged in accounts and ensures passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets. Windows system stores credentials in the LSASS process to enable users to access network resources, such as file shares, SharePoint sites, and other network services, without entering credentials every time a user connects.

Thus, the LSASS process is a juicy target for red teamers because it stores sensitive information about user accounts. The LSASS is commonly abused to dump credentials to either escalate privileges, steal data, or move laterally. Luckily for us, if we have administrator privileges, we can dump the process memory of LSASS. Windows system allows us to create a dump file, a snapshot of a given process. This could be done either with the Desktop access (GUI) or the command prompt. This attack is defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as "[OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/)".

## Graphic User Interface (GUI)  
To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open the Task Manager, and from the Details tab, find the required process, right-click on it, and select "Create dump file".
	![](Pasted%20image%2020241123234825.png)
Once the dumping process is finished, a pop-up message will show containing the path of the dumped file. Copy the file and transfer it to the AttackBox to extract NTLM hashes offline. 

Copy the dumped process to the Mimikatz folder.

Copying the LSASS Dumped file
```markup
C:\Users\Administrator>copy C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\lsass.DMP C:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass.DMP
        1 file(s) copied.
```

## Sysinternals Suite
An alternative way to dump a process if a GUI is not available to us is by using ProcDump. ProcDump is a Sysinternals process dump utility that runs from the command prompt. The SysInternals Suite is already installed in the provided machine at the following path: `c:\Tools\SysinternalsSuite`

We can specify a running process, which in our case is lsass.exe, to be dumped as follows:

Dumping the LSASS Process using procdump.exe 
```markup
c:\>c:\Tools\SysinternalsSuite\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass_dump

Note:
	 The dump process is writing to disk. Dumping the LSASS process is a known technique used by adversaries. Thus, AV products may flag it as malicious. In the real world, you may be more creative and write code to encrypt or implement a method to bypass AV products.

## Mimikatz
[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) is a well-known tool used for extracting passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory using various techniques. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that enables other useful attacks, such as pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or building Golden Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz deals with operating system memory to access information. Thus, it requires administrator and system privileges in order to dump memory and extract credentials.

We will be using the `Mimikatz` tool to extract the memory dump of the lsass.exe process. We have provided the necessary tools for you, and they can be found at: `c:\Tools\Mimikatz`.

Remember that the LSASS process is running as a SYSTEM. Thus in order to access users' hashes, we need a system or local administrator permissions. Thus, open the command prompt and run it as administrator. Then, execute the mimikatz binary as follows:

Running mimikatz With Admin Privileges
```markup
C:\Tools\Mimikatz> mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # 
```

Before dumping the memory for cashed credentials and hashes, we need to enable the SeDebugPrivilege and check the current permissions for memory access. It can be done by executing `privilege::debug` command as follows:

Checking the Current Permission to Access Memory 
```markup
mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK
```

Once the privileges are given, we can access the memory to dump all cached passwords and hashes from the `lsass.exe` process using `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`

Dumping the Stored Clear-text Passwords
```markup
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

```

**Note**:
	To get users' hashes, a user (victim) must have logged in to a system, and the user's credentials have been cached.

## Protected LSASS
In 2012, Microsoft implemented an LSA protection, to keep LSASS from being accessed to extract credentials from memory. This task will show how to disable the LSA protection and dump credentials from memory using Mimikatz. 

To enable LSASS protection, we can modify the registry RunAsPPL DWORD value in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` to 1.

The steps are similar to the previous section, which runs the Mimikatz execution file with admin privileges and enables the debug mode. If the LSA protection is enabled, we will get an error executing the "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" command.

Failing to Dump Stored Password Due to the LSA Protection
```markup
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
ERROR kuhl_m_sekurlsa_acquireLSA ; Handle on memory (0x00000005)
```

The command returns a 0x00000005 error code message (Access Denied). Lucky for us, Mimikatz provides a mimidrv.sys driver that works on kernel level to disable the LSA protection. We can import it to Mimikatz by executing "!+" as follows:

Loading the mimidrv Driver into Memory
```markup
mimikatz # !+
[*] 'mimidrv' service not present
[+] 'mimidrv' service successfully registered
[+] 'mimidrv' service ACL to everyone
[+] 'mimidrv' service started
```

**Note**: 
	If this fails with an `isFileExist` error, exit mimikatz, navigate to `C:\Tools\Mimikatz\` and run the command again.

Once the driver is loaded, we can disable the LSA protection by executing the following Mimikatz command:

Removing the LSA Protection
```markup
mimikatz # !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
Process : lsass.exe
PID 528 -> 00/00 [0-0-0]
```

Now, if we try to run the "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" command again, it must be executed successfully and show cached credentials in memory.
