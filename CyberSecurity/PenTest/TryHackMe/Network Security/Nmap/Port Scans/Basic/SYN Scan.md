Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it *requires a privileged user to run it (root/sudoer).

SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didn’t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. 

We can select this scan type by using the `-sS` option. The figure below shows how the TCP SYN scan works without completing the TCP 3-way handshake.

 1) In the upper half of the following figure, we can see a TCP connect scan `-sT` traffic. Any open TCP port will require Nmap to complete the TCP 3-way handshake before closing the connection. 
 2) In the lower half of the following figure, we see how a SYN scan `-sS` does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, Nmap sends an RST packet once a SYN/ACK packet is received.
