| Decoy Scan                     | `nmap -D DECOY_IP,ME MACHINE_IP`                      |
| Idle (Zombie) Scan             | `sudo nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP MACHINE_IP`                  |
| Fragment IP data into 8 bytes  | `-f`                                                  |
| Fragment IP data into 16 bytes | `-ff`                                                 |

These scan types rely on setting TCP flags in unexpected ways to prompt ports for a reply:
- `Null`, `FIN`, and `Xmas` scan provoke a response from closed ports;
- `Maimon`, `ACK`, and `Window` scans provoke a response from open and closed ports.

|Option|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`--source-port PORT_NUM`|specify source port number|
|`--data-length NUM`|append random data to reach given length|

| Option     | Purpose                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--reason` | explains how Nmap made its conclusion |
| `-v`       | verbose                               |
| `-vv`      | very verbose                          |
| `-d`       | debugging                             |
| `-dd`      | more details for debugging            |

You might consider adding `--reason` if you want Nmap to provide more details regarding its reasoning and conclusions.

Providing the `--reason` flag gives us the explicit reason why Nmap concluded that the system is up or a particular port is open. In this console output above, we can see that this system is considered online because Nmap “received arp-response.” On the other hand, we know that the SSH port is deemed to be open because Nmap received a “syn-ack” packet back.

For more detailed output, you can consider using `-v` for verbose output or `-vv` for even more verbosity.
