Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use `-n` to skip this step.

To have Nmap perform reverse DNS lookups for all possible hosts on a subnet, you should use the `-R` option. This option forces reverse DNS resolution on all the IP addresses in the target range.
