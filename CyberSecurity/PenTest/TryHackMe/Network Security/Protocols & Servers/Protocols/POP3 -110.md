Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.

The example below shows what a POP3 session would look like if conducted via a Telnet client:
- First, the user connects to the POP3 server at the POP3 default port 110.
- Authentication is required to access the email messages; the user authenticates by providing his username `USER frank` and password `PASS D2xc9CgD`.
- Using the command `STAT`, we get the reply `+OK 1 179`; based on [RFC 1939](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1939), a positive response to `STAT` has the format `+OK nn mm`, where _nn_ is the number of email messages in the inbox, and _mm_ is the size of the inbox in octets (byte). 
- The command `LIST` provided a list of new messages on the server
- `RETR 1` retrieved the first message in the list.
```shell
pentester@TryHackMe$ telnet 10.10.179.8 110
Trying 10.10.179.8...
Connected to 10.10.179.8.
Escape character is '^]'.

The example above shows that the commands are sent in cleartext. Using Telnet was enough to authenticate and retrieve an email message. As the username and password are sent in cleartext, any third party watching the network traffic can steal the login credentials.

Note:
	Based on the default settings, the mail client deletes the mail message after it downloads it. The default behaviour can be changed from the mail client settings if you wish to download the emails again from another mail client. Accessing the same mail account via multiple clients using POP3 is usually not very convenient as one would lose track of read and unread messages. To keep all mailboxes synchronized, we need to consider other protocols, such as IMAP.

```shell
telnet 10.10.179.8 110   !!!
Trying 10.10.179.8...
Connected to 10.10.179.8.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK Hello there.
USER frank     !!!
+OK Password required.
PASS D2xc9CgD  !!!
+OK logged in.
STAT      !!!
+OK 0 0
LIST      !!!
+OK POP3 clients that break here, they violate STD53.
