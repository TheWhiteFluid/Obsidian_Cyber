Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronise your inbox.

The default port for IMAP is **143**.
```shell
telnet 10.10.179.8 143 !!!

*Note:*
	It is clear that IMAP sends the login credentials in cleartext, as we can see in the command `LOGIN frank D2xc9CgD`. Anyone watching the network traffic would be able to know Frank’s username and password.
