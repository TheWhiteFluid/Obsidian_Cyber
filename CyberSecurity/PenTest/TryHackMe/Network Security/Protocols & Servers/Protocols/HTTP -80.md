Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer web pages. Web browser connects to the webserver and uses HTTP to request HTML pages and images among other files and submit forms and upload various files.

HTTP sends and receives data as cleartext (not encrypted); therefore, you can use a simple tool, such as Telnet (or Netcat), to communicate with a web server and act as a “web browser”. 

*Note:*
	The key difference is that you need to input the HTTP-related commands instead of the web browser doing that for you.

In the following example, we will see how we can request a page from a web server. To accomplish this, we will use the Telnet client. We chose it because Telnet is a simple protocol; furthermore, it uses cleartext for communication. We will use `telnet` instead of a web browser to request a file from the webserver. The steps will be as follows:

1. First, we connect to port 80 using `telnet MACHINE_IP 80`.
2. Next, we need to type `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1` to retrieve the page `index.html` or `GET / HTTP/1.1` to retrieve the default page.
3. Finally, you need to provide some value for the host like `host: telnet` and press the Enter/Return key **twice**.

```shell
telnet MACHINE_IP 80   !!!
Trying MACHINE_IP...
Connected to MACHINE_IP.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1      !!!
host: telnet                   !!!

*Note:*
	We need an HTTP server (webserver) and an HTTP client (web browser) to use the HTTP protocol. The web server will “serve” a specific set of files to the requesting web browser.

Three popular choices for HTTP servers are:
- [Apache](https://www.apache.org/)
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/)  
- [Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://www.iis.net/)
