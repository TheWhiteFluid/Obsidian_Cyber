Sniffing attack refers to using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target. When a protocol communicates in cleartext, the data exchanged can be captured by a third party to analyse. A simple network packet capture can reveal information, such as the content of private messages and login credentials, if the data isn't encrypted in transit.

A sniffing attack can be conducted using an Ethernet (802.3) network card, provided that the user has proper permissions (root permissions on Linux and administrator privileges on MS Windows). There are many programs available to capture network packets. We consider the following:
1. **Tcpdump** is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
2. **Wireshark** is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
3. **Tshark** is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.

Consider a user checking his email messages using POP3. First, we are going to use Tcpdump to attempt to capture the username and password. In the terminal output below, we used the command `sudo tcpdump port 110 -A`. This attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

We need `sudo` as packet captures require root privileges. We wanted to limit the number of captured and displayed packets to those exchanged with the POP3 server. We know that POP3 uses port 110, so we filtered our packets using `port 110`. Finally, we wanted to display the contents of the captured packets in ASCII format, so we added `-A`.

pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo tcpdump port 110 -A  !!!

We could also use Wireshark to achieve the same results. In the Wireshark window below, we can see that we have entered `pop` in the filter field. Now that we've filtered just the traffic we're interested in, we can see a username and password were captured.

*Note:*
	In brief, any protocol that uses cleartext communication is susceptible to this kind of attack. The only requirement for this attack to succeed is to have access to a system between the two communicating systems. This attack requires attention; the mitigation lies in adding an encryption layer on top of any network protocol. In particular, Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been added to HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and many others. For remote access, Telnet has been replaced by the secure alternative Secure Shell (SSH).
