## Decoder
The Decoder module of Burp Suite gives user data manipulation capabilities. As implied by its name, it not only decodes data intercepted during an attack but also provides the function to encode our own data, prepping it for transmission to the target. Decoder also allows us to create hashsums of data, as well as providing a Smart Decode feature, which attempts to decode provided data recursively until it is back to being plaintext.

**Encoding/Decoding**:
![[Pasted image 20240619190640.png]]

- **Plain**: This refers to the raw text before any transformations are applied.
    
- **URL**: URL encoding is utilized to ensure the safe transfer of data in the URL of a web request. It involves substituting characters for their ASCII character code in hexadecimal format, preceded by a percentage symbol (%). This method is vital for any type of web application testing.
    
    For instance, encoding the forward-slash character (**/**), whose ASCII character code is 47, converts it to **2F** in hexadecimal, thus becoming **%2F** in URL encoding. The Decoder can be used to verify this by typing a forward slash in the input box, then selecting`Encode as -> URL`

- **HTML**: HTML Entities encoding replaces special characters with an ampersand (&), followed by either a hexadecimal number or a reference to the character being escaped, and ending with a semicolon (;). This method ensures the safe rendering of special characters in HTML and helps prevent attacks such as XSS. The HTML option in Decoder allows any character to be encoded into its HTML escaped format or decode captured HTML entities. For instance, to decode a previously discussed quotation mark, input the encoded version and choose `Decode as -> HTML`

- **Base64**: Base64, a commonly used encoding method, converts any data into an ASCII-compatible format. The under-the-hood functioning isn't crucial at this stage; however, interested individuals can find the underlying mathematics [here](https://stackabuse.com/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-python).
    
- **ASCII Hex**: This option transitions data between ASCII and hexadecimal representations. For instance, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each character is converted from its numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal.
    
- **Hex, Octal, and Binary**: These encoding methods apply solely to numeric inputs, converting between decimal, hexadecimal, octal (base eight), and binary representations.
    
- **Gzip**: Gzip compresses data, reducing file and page sizes before browser transmission. Faster load times are highly desirable for developers looking to enhance their SEO score and avoid user inconvenience. Decoder facilitates the manual encoding and decoding of gzip data, although it often isn't valid ASCII/Unicode. 
   
**Hashing**:
							![[Pasted image 20240619190750.png]]

`Hash`In addition to its Encoding/Decoding functionality, Decoder also offers the ability to generate hashsums for our data.

Hashing is a one-way process that transforms data into a unique signature. For a function to qualify as a hashing algorithm, the output it generates must be irreversible. A proficient hashing algorithm ensures that every data input will generate a completely unique hash. For instance, using the MD5 algorithm to produce a hashsum for the text "MD5sum" returns `4ae1a02de5bd02a5515f583f4fca5e8c`. Using the same algorithm for "MD5SUM" yields an entirely different hash despite the close resemblance of the input: `13b436b09172400c9eb2f69fbd20adad`. Therefore, hashes are commonly used to verify the integrity of files and documents, as even a tiny alteration to the file significantly changes the hashsum.

Hashes are used to securely store passwords since the one-way hashing process makes the passwords relatively secure, even if the database is compromised. When a user creates a password, the application hashes and stores it. During login, the application hashes the submitted password and compares it against the stored hash; if they match, the password is correct. Using this method, an application never needs to store the original (plaintext) password.

## Comparer
Comparer, as the name implies, lets us compare two pieces of data, either by ASCII words or by bytes.

## Sequencer
Sequencer allows us to evaluate the entropy, or randomness, of "tokens". Tokens are strings used to identify something and should ideally be generated in a cryptographically secure manner. These tokens could be session cookies or **C**ross-**S**ite **R**equest **F**orgery (CSRF) tokens used to protect form submissions. If these tokens aren't generated securely, then, in theory, we could predict upcoming token values. The implications could be substantial, for instance, if the token in question is used for password resets.
![[Pasted image 20240619191342.png]]

We have two main ways to perform token analysis with Sequencer:
- **Live Capture**: This is the more common method and is the default sub-tab for Sequencer. Live capture lets us pass a request that will generate a token to Sequencer for analysis. For instance, we might want to pass a POST request to a login endpoint to Sequencer, knowing that the server will respond with a cookie. With the request passed in, we can instruct Sequencer to start a live capture. It will then automatically make the same request thousands of times, storing the generated token samples for analysis. After collecting enough samples, we stop the Sequencer and allow it to analyze the captured tokens.
    
- **Manual Load**: This allows us to load a list of pre-generated token samples directly into Sequencer for analysis. Using Manual Load means we don't need to make thousands of requests to our target, which can be noisy and resource-intensive. However, it does require that we have a large list of pre-generated tokens.

 **Live Capture:**
First, capture a request to `http://10.10.192.242/admin/login/` in the Proxy. Right-click on the request and select **Send to Sequencer**.

In the "Token Location Within Response" section, we can select between **Cookie**, **Form field**, and **Custom location**. Since we're testing the loginToken in this case, select the "Form field" radio button and choose the loginToken from the dropdown menu:
![[Pasted image 20240619194441.png]]

A new window will pop up indicating that a live capture is in progress and displaying the number of tokens captured so far. Wait until a sufficient number of tokens are captured (approximately 10,000 should suffice); the more tokens we have, the more precise our analysis will be.

Once around 10,000 tokens are captured, click on **Pause** and then select the **Analyze now** button:
![[Pasted image 20240619194509.png]]

If we wished for periodic updates on the analysis, we could have also selected the "Auto analyze" checkbox. This option tells Burp to perform the entropy analysis after every 2000 requests, providing frequent updates that will become increasingly accurate as more samples are loaded into Sequencer.

At this point, it's also worth noting that we could choose to copy or save the captured tokens for further analysis at a later time.

The generated entropy analysis report is split into four primary sections. The first of these is the **Summary** of the results. The summary gives us the following:
![[Pasted image 20240619195043.png]]

- **Overall result**: This gives a broad assessment of the security of the token generation mechanism. In this case, the level of entropy indicates that the tokens are likely securely generated.
- **Effective entropy**: This measures the randomness of the tokens. The effective entropy of 117 bits is relatively high, indicating that the tokens are sufficiently random and, therefore, secure against prediction or brute force attacks.
- **Reliability**: The significance level of 1% implies that there is 99% confidence in the accuracy of the results. This level of confidence is quite high, providing assurance in the accuracy of the effective entropy estimation.
- **Sample**: This provides details about the token samples analyzed during the entropy testing process, including the number of tokens and their characteristics.
    

While the summary report often provides enough information to assess the security of the token generation process, it's important to remember that further investigation may be necessary in some cases. The character-level and bit-level analysis can provide more detailed insights into the randomness of the tokens, especially when the summary results raise potential concerns.

While the entropy report can provide a strong indicator of the security of the token generation mechanism, there needs to be more definitive proof. Other factors could also impact the security of the tokens, and the nature of probability and statistics means there's always a degree of uncertainty. That said, an effective entropy of 117 bits with a significance level of 1% suggests a robustly secure token generation process.

## Organizer
The Organizer module of Burp Suite is designed to help you store and annotate copies of HTTP requests that you may want to revisit later. This tool can be particularly useful for organizing your penetration testing workflow. Here are some of its key features:

- You can store requests that you want to investigate later, save requests that you've already identified as interesting, or save requests that you want to add to a report later.
- You can send HTTP requests to Burp Organizer from other Burp Modules such as **Proxy** or **Repeater**. You can do this by right-clicking the request and selecting **Send to Organizer** or using the default hotkey `Ctrl + O`. Each HTTP request that you send to Organizer is a read-only copy of the original request saved at the point you sent it to Organizer.
- Requests are stored in a table, which contains columns such as the request index number, the time the request was made, workflow status, Burp tool that the request was sent from, HTTP method, server hostname, URL file path, URL query string, number of parameters in the request, HTTP status code of the response, length of the response in bytes, and any notes that you have made.![[Pasted image 20240619195425.png]]
