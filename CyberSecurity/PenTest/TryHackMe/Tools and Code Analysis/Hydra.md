Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool. Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.

This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn’t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed. A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in, change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use `admin:password` as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough.

## Commands
The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being `user` and a password list being `passlist.txt`, we’d use the following command:

`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP`

### SSH
`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh`

| Option | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `-l`   | specifies the (SSH) username for login |
| `-P`   | indicates a list of passwords          |
| `-t`   | sets the number of threads to spawn    |

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- Hydra will use `root` as the username for `ssh`
- It will try the passwords in the `passwords.txt` file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by `-t 4`

### Post Web Form
We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

| Option                | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l`                  | the username for (web form) login                                                        |
| `-P`                  | the password list to use                                                                 |
| `http-post-form`      | the type of the form is POST                                                             |
| `<path>`              | the login page URL, for example, `login.php`                                             |
| `<login_credentials>` | the username and password used to log in, for example, `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^` |
| `<invalid_response>`  | part of the response when the login fails                                                |
| `-V`                  | verbose output for every attempt                                                         |

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:
`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only `/`, i.e., the main IP address.
- The `username` is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace `^USER^`
- The `password` is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing `^PASS^`
- Finally, `F=incorrect` is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
