File Inclusion and Path Traversal are vulnerabilities that arise when an application allows external input to change the path for accessing files. For example, imagine a library where the catalogue system is manipulated to access restricted books not meant for public viewing. Similarly, in web applications, the vulnerabilities primarily arise from improper handling of file paths and URLs. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to include files not intended to be part of the web application, leading to unauthorized access or execution of code.
