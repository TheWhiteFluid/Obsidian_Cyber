Mitigating the risks associated with insecure deserialisation is paramount in ensuring the security of a web application. By implementing effective defence measures, organisations can significantly reduce the likelihood of exploitation and mitigate potential damage. We will discuss this from the perspective of the red team/pentester and the secure code.

## Red Teamer / Pentester Perspective
- **Codebase analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the application's serialisation mechanisms. Identify potential points of deserialisation and serialisation throughout the codebase.
- **Vulnerability identification**: Use static analysis tools to detect insecure deserialisation vulnerabilities. Look for improper input validation, insecure libraries, and outdated dependencies.
- **Fuzzing and dynamic analysis**: Employ fuzzing techniques to generate invalid or unexpected input data. Use dynamic analysis tools to monitor the application's behavior during runtime.
- **Error handling assessment**: Evaluate how the application handles errors during deserialisation. Look for potential error messages or stack traces that reveal system details.

## Secure Coder Perspective
- **Avoid insecure serialisation formats**: Avoid using inherently insecure serialisation formats like Java serialisation. Choose safer alternatives such as JSON or XML with robust validation mechanisms.
- **Avoid eval and exec**: Avoid using `eval()` and `exec()` functions, as they can execute arbitrary code and pose a significant security risk.
- **Input validation and output encoding**: Implement stringent input validation to ensure that only expected data is accepted. Apply output encoding techniques to sanitise data before serialisation.
- **Secure coding practices**: Follow secure coding practices recommended by security standards and guidelines. Adopt principles such as least privilege, defence in depth, and fail-safe defaults.
- **Adherence to guidelines**: Established secure coding guidelines specific to the programming language or framework.
