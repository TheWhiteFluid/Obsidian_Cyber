Automating scripts during pen-testing is essential for efficiently identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. In this task, we will explore one such tool called **PHP Gadge Chain (PHPGGC)** that plays a crucial role in this process, automating the discovery of insecure deserialisation vulnerabilities. PHPGGC, akin to Ysoserial in the Java ecosystem, helps security professionals assess the security posture of PHP applications and mitigate potential risks.
