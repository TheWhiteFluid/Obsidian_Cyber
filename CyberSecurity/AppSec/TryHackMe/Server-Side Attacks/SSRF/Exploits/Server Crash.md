An attacker could abuse SSRF by crashing the server or creating a denial of service for other hosts. There are multiple instances ([WordPress](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/wordpress-core-unauthenticated-blind-ssrf/), [CairoSVG](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/security/advisories/GHSA-rwmf-w63j-p7gv)) where attackers try to disrupt the availability of a system by launching SSRF attacks.

In this SSRF demonstration, we will illustrate how an attacker can exploit a web application to cause a denial of service on the server. In our scenario, the vulnerability is exploited by supplying a malicious URL that points to a resource which, when accessed by the server, leads to excessive resource consumption or triggers a crash.

For example, the attacker might input a URL pointing to a large file on a slow server or a service that responds with an overwhelming amount of data. When the vulnerable application naively accesses this URL, it engages in an action that exhausts its own system resources, leading to a slowdown or complete crash.

- Once we log in to the dashboard, we will see a tab called `Training` in the navigation bar, which is used to load the training content for the employees.
- Once we click on that tab, we will see that it redirects to the URL `http://hrms.thm/url.php?id=192.168.2.10/trainingbanner.jpg`[](http://hrms.thm/url.php=10.10.19.1/trainingbanner.jpg), which shows training cont

- We notice that the `url.php` file is loading external content displayed here. What if we try to load any other content?
- Try opening the file `http://hrms.thm/url.php?id=10.10.10.10`. Great! - it opened the file for you.

- Now that we know the server is vulnerable to basic SSRF, let's explore the code of `url.php` to make it crash the server.
- Once we access the URL `http://hrms.thm/?url=localhost/url`, we will see the following code at the footer (only works if the user is not logged in).
```php
<?php
....
....
    if ($imageSize < 100) {
		  // Output the image if it's within the size limit
    
		$base64Image = downloadAndEncodeImage($imageUrl);
        echo '<img src="' . htmlspecialchars($base64Image) . '" alt="Image" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">';

    } else {
	 	// Memory Outage - server will crash
    
....
...
```

- The above code shows that the `url.php` loads an image; if the image size exceeds `100KB`, it shows a memory outage message and throws an error.
- Let's try to crash the server by loading an image greater than 100 KB. `http://hrms.thm/url.php?id=192.168.2.10/bigImage.jpg`.

We can see that the threat posed by SSRF vulnerabilities extends beyond unauthorised data access or internal network exposure; it also includes the potential to disrupt or completely incapacitate critical server operations. By manipulating a vulnerable server to make unintended requests, attackers can overload the system, leading to crashes that result in denial of service.
