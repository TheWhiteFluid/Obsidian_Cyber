Blind SSRF refers to a scenario where the attacker can send requests to a target server, but they do not receive direct responses or feedback about the outcome of their requests. In other words, the attacker is blind to the server's responses. This type of SSRF can be more challenging to exploit because the attacker cannot directly see the results of their actions. We will discuss its various examples.
