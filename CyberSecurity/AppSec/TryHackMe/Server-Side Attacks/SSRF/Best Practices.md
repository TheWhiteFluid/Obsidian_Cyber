Mitigation measures for SSRF are essential for preserving the security and integrity of web applications. Implementing robust SSRF mitigation measures helps protect against these risks by **fortifying the application's defences**, **preventing malicious requests**, and **bolstering the overall security posture**. 

As a critical element of web application security, SSRF mitigation measures are instrumental in preserving user data, safeguarding against data breaches, and maintaining trust in the digital ecosystem. A few of the important policies are mentioned below:
- **Implement strict input validation** and sanitize all user-provided input, especially any URLs or input parameters the application uses to make external requests.
- Instead of trying to blocklist or filter out disallowed URLs, **maintain allowlists of trusted URLs or domains**. Only allow requests to these trusted sources.
- **Implement network segmentation** to isolate sensitive internal resources from external access.
- **Implement security headers**, such as Content-Security-Policy, that restricts the application's load of external resources.  
- **Implement strong access controls** for internal resources, so even if an attacker succeeds in making a request, they can't access sensitive data without proper authorization.
- **Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring** to track and analyse incoming requests. Look for unusual or unauthorised requests and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
