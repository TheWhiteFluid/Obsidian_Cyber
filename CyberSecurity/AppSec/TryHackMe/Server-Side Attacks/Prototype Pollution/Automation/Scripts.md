Major Issues During Identification

Identifying prototype pollution is a tricky problem in any language particularly in JavaScript, because of the way JavaScript lets one![automating the prototype pollution](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/fabc3c2e9580c19e3a8cd9c878784ed7.svg) object share its features with another. Detecting this problem automatically with software tools is really hard because it's not straightforward like other common website security problems. Each website or web application is different, and figuring out where prototype pollution might happen requires someone to look closely at the website's code, understand how it works, and see where mistakes might be made.  

Unlike other security issues that can be found by looking for specific patterns or signs, finding prototype pollution needs a deep dive into the website's code by a pentester/developer. It's all about understanding the complex ways objects in JavaScript can affect each other and spotting where something might go wrong. Security tools can help point out possible issues, but they can't catch everything. That's why having people who know how to read and analyse code carefully is so important.

- **[NodeJsScan](https://github.com/ajinabraham/nodejsscan)** is a static security code scanner for Node.js applications. It includes checks for various security vulnerabilities, including prototype pollution. Integrating NodeJsScan into your development workflow can help automatically identify potential security issues in your codebase. 
- [**Prototype Pollution Scanner**](https://github.com/KathanP19/protoscan) is a tool designed to scan JavaScript code for prototype pollution vulnerabilities. It can be used to analyse codebases for patterns that are susceptible to pollution, helping developers identify and address potential security issues in their applications.
- [**PPFuzz**](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/ppfuzz) is another fuzzer designed to automate the process of detecting prototype pollution vulnerabilities in web applications. By fuzzing input vectors that might interact with object properties, `PPFuzz` can help identify points in an application that are susceptible to prototype pollution. 
- Client-side detection by [**BlackFan**](https://github.com/BlackFan/client-side-prototype-pollution) is focused on identifying prototype pollution vulnerabilities in client-side JavaScript. It includes examples of how prototype pollution can be exploited in browsers to perform XSS attacks and other malicious activities. It's a valuable resource for understanding the impact of prototype pollution on the client-side.
