- **Input validation**: Always validate user inputs on both client and server sides. Ensure that the data conforms to the expected format, type, and length. Use regular expressions and built-in validation functions to enforce strong input validation rules.
- **Parameterised queries**: Use parameterised queries (prepared statements) to interact with the database. This approach ensures that user inputs are treated as data, not executable code. Avoid concatenating user inputs directly into SQL queries.
- **ORM usage**: Utilize ORM built-in tools to interact with the database. ORMs abstract SQL queries and help prevent SQL injection by handling user inputs securely. Ensure that the ORM is configured correctly and that any custom SQL queries are parameterised.
- **Escaping and sanitisation**: Escape user inputs to remove any special characters used for injection attacks. Sanitise inputs to remove potentially harmful data before processing or storing it.
- **Allowlist input**: Implement an allowlist approach for input validation. Only allow specific, expected values and reject everything else. This method is more secure than blocklisting known bad values, which can be incomplete

## Application in Popular Frameworks
We'll explore essential practices for safeguarding against ORM injection in widely used ORM frameworks. ORM tools like Doctrine (PHP), SQLAlchemy (Python), Hibernate (Java), and Entity Framework (.NET) provide powerful abstractions for database interactions. However, to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, it's crucial to employ secure coding practices such as parameterised queries, named parameters, and ORM-specific techniques.

- **Doctrine (PHP)**
Use prepared statements with parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

```php
$query = $entityManager->createQuery('SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = :username');
$query->setParameter('username', $username);
$users = $query->getResult();
```

- **SQLAlchemy (Python)**
Leverage SQLAlchemy's ORM and Query API to use parameterised queries, which automatically handle escaping and parameter binding.

```php
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
user = session.query(User).filter_by(username=username).first()
```

- **Hibernate (Java)**
Use named parameters with Hibernate's Query API to ensure inputs are adequately bound and escaped.

```php
String hql = "FROM User WHERE username = :username";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setParameter("username", username);
List results = query.list();
```

- **Entity Framework (.NET)**
Employ parameterised queries in Entity Framework to secure database interactions and mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

```php
var user = context.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Username == username);
```

These practices underscore the importance of adopting secure coding practices tailored to each ORM framework, ensuring robust protection against ORM injection vulnerabilities.
