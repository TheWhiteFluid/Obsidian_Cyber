Identifying ORM injection vulnerabilities involves examining how user inputs are handled within ORM queries. These vulnerabilities typically arise when user inputs are directly embedded into ORM query methods without proper sanitisation or validation. Indicators of potential ORM injection issues include the use of dynamic queries that concatenate user inputs, raw query execution methods, and insufficient use of parameterised queries.

- **Manual code review**: A thorough source code inspection can reveal raw query methods (such as `whereRaw()` in Laravel) that incorporate user inputs directly. Look for concatenated strings or unescaped inputs in ORM methods, which can indicate injection points.
- **Automated scanning**: Use security scanning tools that are designed to detect ORM injection vulnerabilities. These tools analyse the codebase to identify patterns that could lead to injection, such as dynamic query construction or improper input handling.
- **Input validation testing**: Perform manual testing by injecting payloads into application inputs to see if they affect the underlying ORM query. For example, injecting SQL control characters or keywords to determine if they alter the execution of the query.
- **Error-based testing**: Enter deliberately incorrect or malformed data to trigger errors. Detailed error messages can provide insights into the structure of the underlying queries and indicate potential vulnerabilities.

## Frameworks and ORM Injection Testing
|                     |                       |                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Framework  <br>** | **ORM Library  <br>** | **Common Vulnerable Methods  <br>**  |
| Laravel             | Eloquent ORM          | `whereRaw(), DB::raw()`              |
| Ruby on Rails       | Active Record         | `where("name = '#{input}'")`         |
| Django              | Django ORM            | `extra()`, `raw()`                   |
| Spring              | Hibernate             | `createQuery()` with `concatenation` |
| Node.js             | Sequelize             | `sequelize.query()`                  |
The table above highlights various web development frameworks and their associated ORM libraries, detailing common methods that are prone to vulnerabilities. For example, in Laravel, using `whereRaw()` or `DB::raw()` with user inputs can lead to ORM injection, but this can be prevented by using parameterised queries with the `where()` method. Similarly, in Django, methods like `extra()` and `raw()` can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled correctly, while using the filter method with parameterised queries ensures safer database interactions. Understanding these common pitfalls and adopting secure coding practices is crucial for maintaining the security of web applications.

## Exploring the Target Application
 To determine which framework is being used, we can employ various techniques such as inspecting cookies, viewing the source code, and analyzing HTTP headers.
 
- **Verifying cookies**: Examine the cookies set by the application. Frameworks often use unique naming conventions or formats for their session cookies, which can provide clues about the underlying technology.

- **Reviewing source code**: Look through the HTML source code for comments, meta tags, or any embedded scripts that might reveal framework-specific signatures. However, this method may only sometimes be conclusive.

- **Analysing HTTP headers**: HTTP headers can sometimes contain information about the server and framework. Tools like Burp Suite or browser developer tools can be used to inspect these headers.
- **URL structure**: The structure of URLs can give hints about the framework. For instance, certain routing patterns are unique to specific frameworks.
- **Login and error pages**: Authentication pages and error messages can sometimes reveal the framework. Some frameworks have distinctive error pages or login form structures.


Now that we've identified that the application uses Laravel by inspecting the cookies, we can dig deeper by supplying malicious input to further explore its behaviour. Specifically, we'll input `1'` to see how the application handles this data and confirm ORM use. When we visit the site at [https://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com](https://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/), we are prompted to provide input. We enter `1'` into the **Email (Vulnerable)** input field and submit the form to determine how the application processes this input. This particular input is designed to disrupt the query structure and reveal any underlying issues with how the application constructs its queries.

Upon submitting this input, we need to closely observe the application's response. If the application returns an error message, it can provide valuable insights into the query construction process. For instance, an error message such as `SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation` indicates that the input has been improperly handled and concatenated into an SQL query, resulting in a syntax error. The output shows that it uses Laravel's Eloquent ORM, as the error messages and query patterns are characteristic of Eloquent's query builder.

For red teamers, identifying ORM injection vulnerabilities is critical to assessing an application's security posture. ORM injection can be exploited if user inputs are not properly sanitised and validated, leading to unauthorised access or manipulation of database queries. Red teamers can uncover these vulnerabilities by employing techniques such as manual code review, automated scanning, and rigorous input validation testing. Using secure coding practices like parameterised queries and robust input validation is essential to mitigating the risks associated with ORM injection. Regular code reviews and the use of security tools can help developers identify and fix these issues.
