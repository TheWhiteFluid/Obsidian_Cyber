Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) can be mitigated by following best practices and implementing security measures in the application's code. Here's how to mitigate SSTI in Smarty, Jade, and Jinja2:

## Jinja2
1. **Sandbox Mode**: Enable the sandboxed environment in Jinja2 to restrict the template's ability to access unsafe functions and attributes. This prevents the execution of arbitrary Python code. For example:
```python
from jinja2 import Environment, select_autoescape, sandbox

env = Environment(
    autoescape=select_autoescape(['html', 'xml']),
    extensions=[sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment]
)
```

2. **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize inputs to escape or remove potentially dangerous characters and strings that can be interpreted as code. This is crucial when inputs are directly used in template expressions.
3. **Template Auditing**: Regularly review and audit templates for insecure coding patterns, such as directly embedding user input without sanitization.

## Jade (Pug)
1. **Avoid Direct JavaScript Evaluation**: Restrict or avoid using Pug’s ability to evaluate JavaScript code within templates. Use alternative methods to handle dynamic content that do not involve direct code execution. For example:

```node.js
var user = !{JSON.stringify(user)}
h1= user.name
```

Use `!{}` carefully as it allows unescaped output, which can be harmful. Prefer `#{}` which escapes HTML by default.

2. **Validate and Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure all user inputs are validated against a strict schema and sanitized before they are rendered by the template engine. This reduces the risk of malicious code execution.
3. **Secure Configuration Settings**: Use environment settings and configuration options that minimize risks, such as disabling any features that allow script execution.

## Smarty
1. **Disable `{php}` Tags**: Ensure that `{php}` tags are disabled in Smarty configurations to prevent the execution of PHP code within templates.
```php
$smarty->security_policy->php_handling = Smarty::PHP_REMOVE;
$smarty->disable_security = false;
```

2. **Use Secure Handlers**: If you must allow users to customize templates, provide a secure set of tags or modifiers that they can use, which do not allow direct command execution or shell access.
3. 1. **Regular Security Reviews**: Conduct security reviews of the template files and the data handling logic to ensure that no unsafe practices are being used. Regularly update Smarty to keep up with security patches.

## Sandboxing in Template Engines
Sandboxing is a security feature that restricts the execution of potentially harmful code within templates. It limits the actions that templates can perform, such as file operations or system command execution. Proper sandboxing helps prevent security issues like SSTI.

**Importance of Sandboxing**
- **Function Restrictions**: Limits the functions or methods that can be called from within the template, blocking potentially harmful operations.
- **Variable and Data Access**: Controls access to global variables or sensitive data, ensuring templates cannot manipulate or expose critical information.
