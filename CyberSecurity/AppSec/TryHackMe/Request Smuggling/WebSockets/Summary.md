When usingÂ HTTP, the client must make a request before the server can send any information. This complicates the implementation of some application features that require bidirectional communications. For example, suppose you are implementing a web application that needs to send real-time notifications to the user. Since the server can't push information to the user at will, the client would need to constantly poll the server for notifications, requiring lots of wasted requests.

The WebSocket protocol allows the creation of two-way communication channels between a browser and a server by establishing a long-lasting connection that can be used for full-duplex communications.
