## TE.TE Technique

**Transfer Encoding Obfuscation,** also known as **TE.TE** stands for **Transfer-Encoding/Transfer-Encoding**. Unlike the CL.TE or TE.CL methods, the TE.TE technique arises when both the front-end and the back-end servers use the Transfer-Encoding header. In TE.TE technique, the attacker takes advantage of the servers' inconsistent handling of  Transfer-Encoding present in the HTTP headers.

The TE.TE vulnerability doesn't always require multiple Transfer-Encoding headers. Instead, it often involves a single, malformed Transfer-Encoding header that is interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end servers. In some cases, the front-end server might ignore or strip out the malformed part of the header and process the request normally, while the back-end server might interpret the request differently due to the malformed header, leading to request smuggling.

**Example**: 
	An attacker manipulates the Transfer-Encoding header by including "chunked" in malformed variations. This is done to exploit how front-end and back-end servers prioritize the Transfer-Encoding (TE) header over Content-Length (CL). By crafting malformed Transfer-Encoding headers, the attacker aims to make one server ignore the TE header and use CL instead, leading to a discrepancy in how the request boundaries are interpreted between the front-end and back-end servers. This manipulation can result in either a CL.TE or TE.CL situation, depending on which server falls back to using the Content-Length.


## Exploitation
To exploit the TE.TE technique, an attacker may craft a request that includes Transfer-Encoding headers that use different encodings. For example, an attacker sends a request like:

```shell
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked1

4e
POST /update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-length: 15

isadmin=true
0
```

In the above payload, the front-end server encounters two `Transfer-Encoding` headers. The first one is a standard chunked encoding, but the second one, `chunked1`, is non-standard. Depending on its configuration, the front-end server might process the request based on the first `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header and ignore the malformed `chunked1`, interpreting the entire request up to the `0` as a single chunked message.

The back-end server, however, might handle the malformed `Transfer-Encoding: chunked1` differently. It could either reject the malformed part and process the request similarly to the front-end server or interpret the request differently due to the presence of the non-standard header. If it processes only the first 4 bytes as indicated by the `Content-length: 4`, the remaining part of the request starting from `POST /update` is then treated as a separate, new request.

The smuggled request with the `isadmin=true` parameter is processed by the back-end server as if it were a legitimate, separate request. This could lead to unauthorized actions or data modifications, depending on the server's functionality and the nature of the /update endpoint.
