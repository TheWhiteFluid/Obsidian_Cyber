If you check any updated Security Advisories, it is easy to find new reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities discovered monthly. However, the same is not true for DOM-based XSS, which is getting scarce nowadays. The reason is that DOM-based XSS is completely browser-based and does not need to go to the server and back to the client. At one point, a proof of concept [example of DOM-based XSS](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml) could be created using a static HTML page; however, with the improved inherent security of web browsers, DOM-based XSS has become extremely difficult.


## DOM explained
Consider the HTML code of [example.com](http://www.example.com/) in the screenshot below (as fetched on the first of February 2024). We opened the Web Developer Tools using the Firefox web browser and checked the Inspector tab.

The DOM tree shown above is like the following list with sublists:

- `document`
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
    - `html`
        - `head`
            - `title`
            - `meta`
            - `meta`
            - `meta`
            - `style`
        - `body`
            - `div`
                - `h1`
                - `p`
                - `p`
                    - `a`

The tree starts with the `document` node and branches into `DOCTYPE` and `html`. The `html` node branches into `head` and `body`. The `head` has the `title`, a few `meta` tags, and a `style`. In this simple example, the `body` has a single `div` that branches into one `h1` and two `p`. This is a concise page. More practical pages would have tens or hundreds of branches.

Using JavaScript, you can manipulate the DOM tree. For example, you can create a new element using `document.createElement()` and add a child to any element using `element.append()`. Here is an example from [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document).

```javascript
let div = document.createElement("div");
let p = document.createElement("p");
div.append(p);

console.log(div.childNodes); // NodeList [ <p> ]
```

DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities take place within the browser. They don’t need to go to the server and return to the client’s web browser. In other words, the attacker will try to exploit this situation by injecting a malicious script, for example, into the URL, and it will be executed on the client’s side without any role for the server in this. We will present an elementary and minimal static site without relying on the back-end code to demonstrate this concept.


## Vulnerable “Static” Site
Let’s consider the following basic example. It is too simple that it is unrealistic; however, it is enough to demonstrate the DOM-based XSS.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Vulnerable Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="greeting"></div>
    <script>
        const name = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('name');
        document.write("Hello, " + name);   // real issue
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The page above expects the user to provide their name after `?name=`. In the screenshot below:
1. The user has entered Web Tester after `?name` in the URL.
2. The greeting worked as expected and displayed “Hello, Web Tester”.
3. Finally, the DOM structure on the right is left intact; the `<body>` has three direct children.

The user might try to inject a malicious script. In the screenshot below, we see the following:
1. The user added `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` instead of only `Web Tester` as their name.
2. The script was executed, and an alert dialogue box was displayed.
3. Most importantly, we can see how the DOM tree got a new element. `<body>` has four children now.
	![](Pasted%20image%2020250201192410.png)

This basic example illustrates a couple of things:
- The server has no direct role in DOM-based vulnerabilities. In this demonstration, everything took place on the client’s browser without using a back end.
- The DOM was insecurely modified using `document.write()`.

**Fixed code**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Secure Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="greeting"></div>
    <script>
        const name = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('name');
        
        // Escape the user input to prevent XSS attacks
        const escapedName = encodeURIComponent(name);
        document.getElementById("greeting").textContent = "Hello, " + escapedName;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

One way to fix this page is by avoiding adding user input directly with `document.write()`. Instead, we first escaped the user input using `encodeURIComponent()` and then added it to `textContent`.

The previous attempt does not work now. We can see that:

1. The user has added JavaScript as part of their input.
2. The JavaScript code is displayed as encoded characters and presents no threat in the current context.
3. The DOM structure is no longer affected when the user attempts to add code as part of their submitted name.
