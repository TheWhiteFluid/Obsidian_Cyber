CSRF plays a critical role for pentesters, allowing them to simulate attacks where users unwittingly execute unauthorised actions on trusted websites. By exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities, pentesters can assess the effectiveness of an application's defences against forged requests, identify potential security gaps in session management, and evaluate the robustness of implemented anti-CSRF measures. Following are some of the critical measures that are recommended for pentesters and secure coders.

## Pentesters/Red Teamers
- **CSRF Testing**: Actively test applications for CSRF vulnerabilities by attempting to execute unauthorised actions through manipulated requests and assess the effectiveness of implemented protections. 
- **Boundary Validation**: Evaluate the application's validation mechanisms, ensuring that user inputs are appropriately validated and anti-CSRF tokens are present and correctly verified to prevent request forgery.
- **Security Headers Analysis**: Assess the presence and effectiveness of security headers, such as CORS and Referer, to enhance the overall security and prevent various attack vectors, including CSRF.
- **Session Management Testing**: Examine the application's session management mechanisms, ensuring that session tokens are securely generated, transmitted, and validated to prevent unauthorised access and actions.
- **CSRF Exploitation Scenarios**: Explore various CSRF exploitation scenarios, such as embedding malicious requests in image tags or exploiting trusted endpoints, to identify potential weaknesses in the application's defences and improve security measures.

## Secure Coders
- **Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Integrate anti-CSRF tokens into each form or request to ensure that only requests with valid and unpredictable tokens are accepted, thwarting CSRF attacks. 
- **SameSite Cookie Attribute**: Set the SameSite attribute on cookies to '**Strict**' or '**Lax**' to control when cookies are sent with cross-site requests, minimising the risk of CSRF by restricting cookie behaviour.
- **Referrer Policy**: Implement a strict referrer policy, limiting the information disclosed in the referer header and ensuring that requests come from trusted sources, thereby preventing unauthorised cross-site requests.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Utilise CSP to define and enforce a policy that specifies the trusted sources of content, mitigating the risk of injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Double-Submit Cookie Pattern**: Implement a secure double-submit cookie pattern, where an anti-CSRF token is stored both in a cookie and as a request parameter. The server then compares both values to authenticate requests.
- **Implement CAPTCHAS**: Secure developers can incorporate CAPTCHA challenges as an additional layer of defense against CSRF attacks especially in user authentication, form submissions, and account creation processes.
