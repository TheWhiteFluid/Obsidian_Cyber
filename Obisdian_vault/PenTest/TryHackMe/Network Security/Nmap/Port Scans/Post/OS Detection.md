## OS Detection
Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using `-O`; this is an _uppercase O_ as in OS.
```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS -O 10.10.162.84

*Note:*
	The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

## Traceroute
If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add `--traceroute`

*Note:*
	Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the `traceroute` command found on Linux and macOS or `tracert` found on MS Windows. Standard `traceroute` starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.
	It is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses.

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.162.84
