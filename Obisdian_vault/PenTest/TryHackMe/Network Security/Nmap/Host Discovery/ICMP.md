Many firewalls block ICMP echo; new versions of MS Windows are configured with a host firewall that blocks ICMP echo requests by default. Remember that an ARP query will precede the ICMP request if your target is on the same subnet.

**ICMP Echo**
	To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option `-PE`. (Remember to add `-sn` if you don’t want to follow that with a port scan.)

**ICMP Timestamp**
	To use ICMP timestamp echo request to discover live hosts, add the option `-PP`

**ICMP Address Mask**
	To use ICMP address mask echo request to discover live hosts, add the option `-PM`

**Note:** Based on earlier scans, we know that at least eight hosts are up, this scan returned none. The reason is that the target system or a firewall on the route is blocking this type of ICMP packet. Therefore, it is essential to learn multiple approaches to achieve the same result. If one type of packet is being blocked, we can always choose another to discover the target network and services.
