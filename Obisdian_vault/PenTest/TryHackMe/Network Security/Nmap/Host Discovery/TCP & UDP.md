### TCP SYN Ping
We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response. 
- An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); 
- A closed port would result in an RST (Reset).

If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option `-PS` followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them.

*Examples:*
- `-PS21` will target port 21.
-  `-PS21-25` will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. 
- `-PS80,443,8080` will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

*Note:*
	- **Privileged** users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and don’t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open.
	- **Unprivileged** users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.

### TCP ACK Ping
*Note:*
	You must be running Nmap as a privileged user.
	 If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.

The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. `-PA` should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider `-PA21`, `-PA21-25` and `-PA80,443,8080`. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.

### UDP Ping
Contrary to TCP ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

The syntax to specify the ports is similar to that of TCP SYN ping and TCP ACK ping; Nmap uses `-PU` for UDP ping.

### Masscan
Masscan uses a similar approach to discover the available systems. However, to finish its network scan quickly, Masscan is quite aggressive with the rate of packets it generates. The syntax is quite similar: `-p` can be followed by a port number, list, or range.

*Examples:*
- `masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443`
- `masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p80,443`
- `masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p22-25`
