Secure Shell (SSH) was created to provide a secure way for remote system administration. In other words, it lets you securely connect to another system over the network and execute commands on the remote system. Put simply, the “S” in SSH stands for secure, which can be summarized simply as:
1. You can confirm the identity of the remote server
2. Exchanged messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient
3. Both sides can detect any modification in the messages

To use SSH, you need an SSH server and an SSH client. The SSH server listens on port 22 by default. The SSH client can authenticate using:
- A username and a password
- A private and public key (after the SSH server is configured to recognize the corresponding public key)

On Linux, macOS, and MS Windows builds after 2018, you can connect to an SSH server using the following command `ssh username@MACHINE_IP`.

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ ssh mark@MACHINE_IP  !!!
mark@MACHINE_IP's password: XBtc49AB  !!!

*Note:*
	If this is the first time we connect to this system, we will need to confirm the fingerprint of the SSH server’s public key to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In the case of SSH, we don’t usually have a third party to check if the public key is valid, so we need to do this manually. This attack is shown in the image below.

We can use SSH to transfer files using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) based on the SSH protocol. An example of the syntax is as follows: `scp mark@MACHINE_IP:/home/mark/archive.tar.gz ~`.
	This command will copy a file named `archive.tar.gz` from the remote system located in the `/home/mark` directory to `~`, i.e., the root of the home directory of the currently logged-in user.

Another example syntax is `scp backup.tar.bz2 mark@MACHINE_IP:/home/mark/`. This command will copy the file `backup.tar.bz2` from the local system to the directory `/home/mark/` on the remote system.
```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ scp document.txt mark@MACHINE_IP:/home/mark !!!
mark@MACHINE_IP's password:     !!!
document.txt                                        100% 1997KB  70.4MB/s   00:00
```

*Note:*
	FTP could be secured using SSL/TLS by using the FTPS protocol which uses port 990. It is worth mentioning that FTP can also be secured using the SSH protocol which is the SFTP protocol. By default this service listens on port 22, just like SSH.
