Apart from the vulnerabilities discussed earlier, attackers can exploit several other critical weaknesses in OAuth 2.0 implementations. The following are some additional vulnerabilities that pentesters should be aware of while pentesting an application.
﻿
## Insufficient Token Expiry
Access tokens with long or infinite lifetimes pose a significant security risk. If an attacker obtains such a token, they can access protected resources indefinitely. Implementing short-lived access and refresh tokens helps mitigate this risk by limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.

## Replay Attacks  
Replay attacks involve capturing valid tokens and reusing them to gain unauthorized access. Attackers can exploit tokens multiple times without mechanisms to detect and prevent token reuse. Implementing `nonce` values and `timestamp` checks can help mitigate replay attacks by ensuring each token is used only once.

## Insecure Storage of Tokens
Storing access tokens and refresh tokens insecurely (e.g., in local storage or unencrypted files) can lead to token theft and unauthorized access. Using secure storage mechanisms, such as secure cookies or encrypted databases, can protect tokens from being accessed by malicious actors.

# Evolution of OAuth 2.1
OAuth 2.1 represents the latest iteration in the evolution of the OAuth standard, building on the foundation of OAuth 2.0 to address its shortcomings and enhance security. The journey from OAuth 2.0 to OAuth 2.1 has been driven by the need to mitigate known vulnerabilities and incorporate best practices that have emerged since the original specification was published. OAuth 2.0, while widely adopted, had several areas that required improvement, particularly in terms of security and interoperability.

## Major Changes
OAuth 2.1 introduces several key changes aimed at strengthening the protocol.

- One of the most significant updates is the deprecation of the `implicit grant type`, which was identified as a major security risk due to token exposure in URL fragments. Instead, OAuth 2.1 recommends the authorization code flow with *PKCE* for public clients.
- Additionally, OAuth 2.1 mandates using the `state` parameter to protect against *CSRF* attacks. 
- OAuth 2.1 also emphasizes the importance of `secure handling and storage of tokens`. It advises against storing tokens in browser local storage due to the risk of *XSS* attacks and recommends using secure cookies instead.
- Moreover, OAuth 2.1 enhances interoperability by providing clearer guidelines for `redirect URI validation`, client authentication, and scope validation. 

In summary, OAuth 2.1 builds on OAuth 2.0 by addressing its security gaps and incorporating best practices to offer a more secure and protected authorization framework. For more detailed information on OAuth 2.1, you can refer to the official specification [here](https://oauth.net/2.1/).
