The OTP leakage in the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) response typically happens due to poor implementation of the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) mechanism or insecure coding. Some common reasons why this happens are because of:

**Server-Side Validation and Return of Sensitive Data**
In some poorly designed applications, the server validates the OTP, and rather than just confirming success or failure, it returns the OTP itself in the response. This is often done unintentionally, as part of debugging, logging, or poor response handling practices.

**Lack of Proper Security Practices**
Developers might overlook the security implications of exposing sensitive information like OTP in the API responses. This often happens when developers are focused on making the application functional without considering how attackers could exploit these responses.

Not all developers are fully aware of secure coding practices. They might implement features like 2FA without fully understanding the potential risks of exposing sensitive information in the XHR response.

**Debugging Information Left in Production**
During the development or testing phase, developers might include detailed debugging information in responses to help diagnose issues. If these debug responses are not removed before deploying to production, sensitive information like OTPs could be exposed.

Copy the value of the token parameter and paste it into the OTP form, then click Verify Account.
