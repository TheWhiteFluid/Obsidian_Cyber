### Key Points and Potential Attacks on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

**1. Common MFA Vulnerabilities:**

- **Brute-force attacks on 2FA codes:** Attackers may repeatedly guess the second-factor code using automated tools, especially if codes are short and not rate-limited. This can lead to account compromise even after the first authentication step is secured.
- **Flawed verification logic:** If the logic that validates the 2FA token is weak or can be bypassed, attackers may skip the second step entirely, exploiting issues in the application's flow​
- **Social engineering (MFA fatigue):** Attackers flood users with push notifications, tricking them into approving login attempts. Users overwhelmed by the flood of requests may mistakenly authorize malicious logins, believing them to be legitimate or simply seeking to stop the notifications​

**2. Attacks and Exploits:**

- **Credential stuffing combined with MFA fatigue:** If attackers have valid usernames and passwords, they can leverage push notification spamming to gain unauthorized access, exploiting human behavior rather than technical flaws​
- **Session hijacking after first-factor success:** Attackers may manipulate sessions to skip the 2FA step by exploiting session cookies issued after password verification but before completing MFA​

**3. Best Practices to Secure MFA:**

- **Strong token validation:** Ensure robust verification of 2FA codes, with protections against brute force, such as rate limiting and account lockouts after failed attempts​
- **User awareness and push notification limits:** Educate users about MFA fatigue attacks and implement limits on push notifications to prevent abuse​
- **Multi-layered authentication checks:** Separate sessions for each authentication stage, ensuring that a user cannot bypass MFA by exploiting the first-step session token​
