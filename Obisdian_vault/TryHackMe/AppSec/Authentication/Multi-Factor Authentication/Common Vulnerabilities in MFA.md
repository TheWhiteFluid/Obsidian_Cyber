### Weak OTP Generation Algorithms
The security of a One-Time Password (OTP) is only as strong as the algorithm used to create it. If the algorithm is weak or too predictable, it can make the attacker's job easier trying to guess the OTP. If an algorithm doesn't use truly random seeds, the OTPs generated might follow a pattern, making them more susceptible to prediction.

### Application Leaking the 2FA Token
If an application handles data poorly or has vulnerabilities like insecure API endpoints, it might accidentally leak the 2FA token in the application's HTTP response.

Due to insecure coding, some applications might also leak the 2FA token in the response. A common scenario is when a user, after login, arrives on the 2FA page, the application will trigger an XHR request to an endpoint that issues the OTP. Sometimes, this XHR request returns the OTP back to the user inside the HTTP response.

### Brute Forcing the OTP
Even though OTPs are designed for one-time use, they aren't immune to brute-force attacks. If an attacker can make unlimited guesses, they might eventually get the correct OTP, especially if the OTP isn't well protected by additional security measures. It's like trying to crack a safe by turning the dial repeatedly until it clicks open, given enough time and no restrictions, it might just work.

**Lack of Rate Limiting**
Without proper rate limiting, an application is open to attackers to keep trying different OTPs without difficulty. If an attacker can submit multiple guesses in a short amount of time, it increases the likelihood that the attacker will be able to get the correct OTP.

For example, in this HackerOne [report](https://hackerone.com/reports/121696), the tester was able to report a valid bug since the application doesn't employ rate limiting in the checking of the 2FA code.


### Usage of Evilginx
[Evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) is a tool that is typically used in red team engagements. As it can be used to execute sophisticated phishing attacks, effectively bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It operates as a man-in-the-middle proxy that can intercept and redirect OTPs meant for legitimate users.
