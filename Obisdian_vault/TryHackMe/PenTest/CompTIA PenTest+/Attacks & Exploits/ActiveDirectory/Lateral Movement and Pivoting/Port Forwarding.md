Most of the lateral movement techniques we have presented require specific ports to be available for an attacker. In real-world networks, the administrators may have blocked some of these ports for security reasons or have implemented segmentation around the network, preventing you from reaching *SMB, RDP, WinRM or RPC ports*.

To go around these restrictions, we can use port forwarding techniques, which consist of *using any compromised host as a jump box to pivot to other hosts*. It is expected that some machines will have more network permissions than others, as every role in a business will have different needs in terms of what network services are required for day-to-day work.
