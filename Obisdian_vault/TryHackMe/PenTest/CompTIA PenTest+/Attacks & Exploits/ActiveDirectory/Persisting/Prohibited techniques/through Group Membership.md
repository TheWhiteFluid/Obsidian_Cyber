If we don't want to tamper with SID histories, we can just add ourselves directly to AD groups for persistence. While SID history is a great persistence technique, credential rotation and cleanup can still remove our persistence. In certain cases, it may be better to perform persistence by targeting the AD groups themselves.

While privileged accounts or groups like Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins provide significant power, they are also heavily monitored and scrutinized. To persist undetected, it’s often more effective to target less-obvious groups that still offer useful privileges:

- **IT Support Groups**: Membership in these groups can allow actions like forcing password changes. While privileged accounts may be off-limits for resets, gaining control over low-privileged accounts can help spread access across workstations.
- **Groups with Local Administrator Rights**: These groups are generally less monitored than protected groups. By targeting a network support group that grants local admin rights to key hosts, you can establish persistence with access that may later be leveraged to re-compromise the domain.
- **Groups with Indirect Privileges**: Sometimes, groups that control specific resources, like ownership of Group Policy Objects (GPOs), can be just as effective. Manipulating GPOs can provide indirect but powerful control over the environment.

Choosing these less obvious paths can make persistence harder to detect and disrupt.
