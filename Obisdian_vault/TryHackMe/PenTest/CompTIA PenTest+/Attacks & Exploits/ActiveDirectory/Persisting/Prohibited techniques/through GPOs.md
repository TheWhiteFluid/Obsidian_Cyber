The last persistence technique we will review is persistence through Group Policy Objects (GPOs). At this point, you should be familiar with GPOs based on all the different enumeration, attack, and exploitation techniques we have discussed. However, GPOs are also excellent for deploying persistence.

Group Policy Management in AD provides a central mechanism to manage the local policy configuration of all domain-joined machines. *This includes configuration such as membership to restricted groups, firewall and AV configuration, and which scripts should be executed upon startup*. While this is an excellent tool for management, it can be targeted by attackers to deploy persistence across the entire estate. What is even worse is that the attacker can often hide the GPO in such a way that it becomes almost impossible to remove it.

## Domain Wide Persistence
The following are some common GPO persistence techniques:
- **Restricted Group Membership** - This could allow us administrative access to all hosts in the domain
- **Logon Script Deployment** - This will ensure that we get a shell callback every time a user authenticates to a host in the domain.
