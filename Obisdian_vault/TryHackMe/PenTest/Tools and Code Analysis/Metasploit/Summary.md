Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.
  
The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows:
- *msfconsole*: The main command-line interface.
- *modules*: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- *tools*: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development
  
## **Main** **Components**
While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the Metasploit console. You can launch it from the AttackBox terminal using the `msfconsole` command. The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit Framework. Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload:
- ***Exploit*:** A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- ***Vulnerability*:** A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- ***Payload*:** An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

|**Module**|**Purpose**|**Types**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Exploit Modules**|Used to exploit specific vulnerabilities in target systems and deliver payloads.|- **Remote**: Over-the-network vulnerabilities  <br>- **Local**: Local system vulnerabilities post-compromise|`exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`|
|**Payload Modules**|Execute actions on target systems post-exploitation, like reverse shells.|- **Singles**: Small, single-purpose payloads  <br>- **Stagers**: Establish initial connection  <br>- **Stages**: Large, staged payloads|`payload/windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`|
|**Auxiliary Modules**|Non-exploit functions like scanning, fuzzing, and brute-forcing.|- **Scanners**: Network scanning  <br>- **DoS**: Denial-of-service  <br>- **Fuzzers**: Vulnerability discovery|`auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`|
|**Post-Exploitation Modules**|Execute tasks after gaining access to a system, such as information gathering and privilege escalation.|- **Gather**: Collect data  <br>- **Escalate**: Increase privileges  <br>- **Manage**: Maintain access|`post/windows/gather/hashdump`|
|**Encoder Modules**|Obfuscate payloads to bypass antivirus detection.|- **XOR**, **Base64**, **Shikata Ga Nai**|`encoder/x86/shikata_ga_nai`|
|**NOP Modules**|Create NOP sleds to pad exploits for reliability and alignment in memory.|- **NOP Generators**|`nop/x86/opty2`|
|**Evasion Modules**|Help evade detection by antivirus and security solutions on target systems.|- **Antivirus Bypass**, **Defender Disable**|`evasion/windows/windows_defender_disable`|
|**Exploit Development Modules**|Assist in developing custom exploits, debugging, and testing.|- **Multi/Handler**|`exploit/multi/handler`|

## Modules
### Auxiliary
Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.

### Encoders
Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them. Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.
![[Pasted image 20240813234424.png]]

### Evasion
While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.

### Exploits 
Exploits, neatly organized by target system.
![[Pasted image 20240813234548.png]]

### NOPs
NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.
![[Pasted image 20240813234702.png]]

### Payloads
Payloads are codes that will run on the target system. Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launching calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. Starting the calculator on the target system remotely by launching the calc.exe application is a benign way to show that we can run commands on the target system.

Running command on the target system is already an important step but having an interactive connection that allows you to type commands that will be executed on the target system is better. Such an interactive command line is called a "shell". Metasploit offers the ability to send different payloads that can open shells on the target system.
![[Pasted image 20240813234833.png]]

- **Adapters:** An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.  
- **Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
- **Stagers:** Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
- **Stages:** Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

*Note:*
	Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify `single` (also called “inline”) payloads and `staged` payloads.

-   generic/shell_reverse_tcp
-   windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

	Both are reverse Windows shells. The former is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the `__` between “shell” and “reverse”. While the latter is a staged payload, as indicated by the `/` between “shell” and “reverse”.

### Post
Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.
![[Pasted image 20240813235434.png]]

## Msfconsole
Once launched, you will see the command line changes to msf6 (or msf5 depending on the installed version of Metasploit). The Metasploit console (msfconsole) can be used just like a regular command-line shell, as you can see below. The first command is `ls` which lists the contents of the folder from which Metasploit was launched using the `msfconsole` command.

You can use the `history` command to see commands you have typed earlier.
![[Pasted image 20240814030226.png]]

We will use the MS17-010 “Eternalblue” exploit for illustration purposes.
Once you type the `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` command, you will see the command line prompt change from msf6 to “*msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue)*”.
![[Pasted image 20240814030434.png]]

### **Show options**
The prompt tells us we now have a context set in which we will work. You can see this by typing the `show options` command:
![[Pasted image 20240814030709.png]]

The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. The example below lists payloads that can be used with the ms17-010 Eternalblue exploit.
![[Pasted image 20240814031014.png]]

If used from the msfconsole prompt, the `show` command will list all modules. The `use` and `show options` commands we have seen so far are identical for all modules in Metasploit.

You can leave the context using the `back` command.
![[Pasted image 20240814031046.png]]

### **Info**
Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command within its context. Alternatively, you can use the `info` command followed by the module’s path from the msfconsole prompt (e.g. `info exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`). Info is not a help menu; it will display detailed information on the module such as its author, relevant sources, etc.
![[Pasted image 20240814031124.png]]

### **Search**
One of the most useful commands in msfconsole is `search`. This command will search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names (eternalblue, heartbleed, etc.), or target system.
![[Pasted image 20240814031719.png]]

The output of the `search` command provides an overview of each returned module. You may notice the “name” column already gives more information than just the module name. You can see the type of module (auxiliary, exploit, etc.) and the category of the module (scanner, admin, windows, Unix, etc.). You can use any module returned in a search result with the command use followed by the number at the beginning of the result line. (e.g. `use 0` instead of `use auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command`)

Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. The table below provides their respective descriptions.
![[Pasted image 20240814031749.png]]

You can direct the search function using keywords such as type and platform. For example, if we wanted our search results to only include auxiliary modules, we could set the type to auxiliary. The screenshot below shows the output of the `search type:auxiliary telnet` command.
![[Pasted image 20240814031911.png]]

Note:
	Exploits take advantage of a vulnerability on the target system and may always show unexpected behavior. A low-ranking exploit may work perfectly, and an excellent ranked exploit may not, or worse, crash the target system.


## ***eternalblue*** 
Once you have entered the context of a module using the `use` command followed by the module name, as seen earlier, you will need to set parameters. The most common parameters you will use are listed below. Remember, based on the module you use, additional or different parameters may need to be set. It is good practice to use the `show options` command to list the required parameters. All parameters are set using the same command syntax:   `set PARAMETER_NAME VALUE`

![[Pasted image 20240814032612.png]]

Some of these parameters require a value for the exploit to work. Some required parameter values will be pre-populated, make sure you check if these should remain the same for your target. For example, a web exploit could have an RPORT (remote port: the port on the target system Metasploit will try to connect to and run the exploit) value preset to 80, but your target web application could be using port 8080.

In this example, we will set the RHOSTS parameter to the IP address of our target system using the `set` command:
![[Pasted image 20240814035621.png]]

Parameters you will often use are:
- *RHOSTS*: “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using `file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt`
- *RPORT*: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- *PAYLOAD*: The payload you will use with the exploit.
- *LHOST*: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
- *LPORT*: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- *SESSION*: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

You can override any set parameter using the set command again with a different value. You can also clear any parameter value using the `unset` command or clear all set parameters with the `unset all` command.
![[Pasted image 20240814040210.png]]

You can use the `setg` command to set values that will be used for all modules. The `setg` command is used like the set command. The difference is that if you use the `set` command to set a value using a module and you switch to another module, you will need to set the value again. The `setg` command allows you to set the value so it can be used by default across different modules. You can clear any value set with `setg` using `unsetg`.

The `setg` command sets a global value that will be used until you exit Metasploit or clear it using the `unsetg` command.

#### Using Modules
Once all module parameters are set, you can launch the module using the `exploit` command. Metasploit also supports the `run` command, which is an alias created for the `exploit` command as the word exploit did not make sense when using modules that were not exploits (port scanners, vulnerability scanners, etc.) The `exploit -z` command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.
![[Pasted image 20240814040408.png]]

#### Sessions
Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit. You can use the `background` command to background the session prompt and go back to the msfconsole prompt.
![[Pasted image 20240814040808.png]]

The `sessions` command can be used from the msfconsole prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.
![[Pasted image 20240814040911.png]]

To interact with any session, you can use the `sessions -i` command followed by the desired session number.
