When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers. Whenever a user tries to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, the service will need to ask the Domain Controller to verify if they are correct. Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:
- **Kerberos:** Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.
- **NetNTLM:** Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.

## Kerberos Authentication
Kerberos authentication is the default authentication protocol for any recent version of Windows. Users who log into a service using Kerberos will be assigned tickets. Think of tickets as proof of a previous authentication. Users with tickets can present them to a service to demonstrate they have already authenticated into the network before and are therefore enabled to use it.

1. The user sends their username and a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from their password to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, a service usually installed on the Domain Controller in charge of creating Kerberos tickets on the network.
   
    The **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** will create and send back a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**, which will allow the user to request additional tickets to access specific services. The need for a ticket to get more tickets may sound a bit weird, but it allows users to request service tickets without passing their credentials every time they want to connect to a service. Along with the TGT, a **Session Key** is given to the user, which they will need to generate the following requests.
    
    Note:
	     The **TGT** is encrypted using the **krbtgt** account's password hash, and therefore the user can't access its contents. It is essential to know that the encrypted **TGT** includes a copy of the *Session Key* as part of its contents, and the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** has no need to store the *Session Key* as it can recover a copy by decrypting the **TGT** if needed.

2. When a user wants to connect to a service on the network like a share, website or database, they will use their **TGT** to ask the KDC for a **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**. **TGS** are tickets that allow connection only to the specific service they were created for. To request a **TGS**, the user will send their username and a timestamp encrypted using the *Session Key*, along with the **TGT** and a **Service Principal Name (SPN),** which indicates the service and server name we intend to access.
    
    As a result, the KDC will send us a **TGS** along with a ***Service Session Key***, which we will need to authenticate to the service we want to access. The **TGS** is encrypted using a key derived from the **Service Owner Hash**. The Service Owner is the user or machine account that the service runs under. The **TGS** contains a copy of the ***Service Session Key*** on its encrypted contents so that the Service Owner can access it by decrypting the **TGS**.

3. The **TGS** can then be sent to the desired service to authenticate and establish a connection. The service will use its configured *account's password hash* to decrypt the **TGS** and validate the *Service Session Key*.

## NetNTLM Authentication
NetNTLM works using a challenge-response mechanism. 
The entire process is as follows:
1. The client *sends an authentication request* to the server they want to access.
2. The server *generates a random number* and sends it as a *challenge* to the client.
	   ***challenge = random number***
3. The client combines their **NTLM** *password hash* with the *challenge* (and other known data) to *generate a response* to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
	   ***client_response = challenge + password_hash***
4. The server *forwards* the *challenge* and the *response* to the **Domain Controller** for verification.
5. The domain controller uses the *challenge* to recalculate the *response* and *compares it to the original response* sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
	   ***expected_response =  challenge + password_hash***
	   if(expected_response = client_response):
		   acces granted
	   else:
		   acces denied
   
6. The server forwards the authentication result to the client.

**Note:**
- The user's password (or hash) is **never** transmitted through the network for security.
- The described process applies when using a domain account. If a local account is used, the server can verify the response to the challenge itself without requiring interaction with the domain controller since it has the password hash stored locally on its SAM.
