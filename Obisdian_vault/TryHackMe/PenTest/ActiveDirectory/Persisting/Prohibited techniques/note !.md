**The techniques discussed from this point forward are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have signoff on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild !! 

Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be de chained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them.
