**Credential Harvesting** means stealing usernames and passwords from users or systems. Attackers use this technique to find and steal stored credentials, such as login details or account names.

There are many ways to harvest credentials, such as:
- **Network sniffing**, where attackers capture credentials sent over the network.
- **Searching for stored credentials** in places like plain text files, the system registry, or memory dumps.

Credentials can be found in a variety of different forms, such as:
- Accounts details (usernames and passwords)
- Hashes that include NTLM hashes, etc.
- Authentication Tickets: Tickets Granting Ticket (TGT), Ticket Granting Server (TGS)  
- Any information that helps login into a system (private keys, etc.)

Generally speaking, there are two types of credential harvesting: 
 - *External credential harvesting* (phishing emails and other techniques to trick a user into entering his username and password). 
-  *Internal credential harvesting* (obtaining credentials through the internal network uses different approaches).
