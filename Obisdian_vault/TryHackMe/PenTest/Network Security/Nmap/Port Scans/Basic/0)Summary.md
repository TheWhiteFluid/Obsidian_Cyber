| Option                  | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-p-`                   | all ports                                |
| `-p1-1023`              | scan ports 1 to 1023                     |
| `-F`                    | 100 most common ports                    |
| `-r`                    | scan ports in consecutive order          |
| `-T<0-5>`               | -T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest |
| `--max-rate 50`         | rate <= 50 packets/sec                   |
| `--min-rate 15`         | rate >= 15 packets/sec                   |
| `--min-parallelism 100` | at least 100 probes in parallel          |

## **Fine-Tuning Scope and Performance**
You can specify the ports you want to scan instead of the default 1000 ports

*Example:*
- port list: `-p22,80,443` will scan ports 22, 80 and 443.
- port range: `-p1-1023` will scan all ports between 1 and 1023 inclusive, while `-p20-25` will scan ports between 20 and 25 inclusive.

You can request the scan of all ports by using `-p-`, which will scan all 65535 ports. If you want to scan the most common 100 ports, add `-F`. Using `--top-ports 10` will check the ten most common ports.

You can control the scan timing using `-T<0-5>`. `-T0` is the slowest (paranoid), while `-T5` is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:
- ***paranoid (0)***
- ***sneaky (1)***
- ***polite (2)***
- ***normal (3)***
- ***aggressive (4)***
- ***insane (5)***

*Note:*
	 `-T4` is often used during CTFs and when learning to scan on practice targets
	 `-T1` is often used during real engagements where stealth is more important.

**Packet rate**:
Control the packet rate using `--min-rate <number>` and `--max-rate <number>`. For example, `--max-rate 10` or `--max-rate=10` ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.

**Parallelization**:
Control probing parallelization using `--min-parallelism <numprobes>` and `--max-parallelism <numprobes>`. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel.

*Example:*
	 `--min-parallelism=512` pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.
