A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. Many programs provide additional functionality via scripts; moreover, scripts make it possible to add custom functionality that did not exist via the built-in commands.

Nmap default installation can easily contain close to 600 scripts at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`.

 You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using `--script=default` or simply adding `-sC`. In addition to [default](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/default.html), categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table:

| Script Category | Description                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`          | Authentication related scripts                                         |
| `broadcast`     | Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages                           |
| `brute`         | Performs brute-force password auditing against logins                  |
| `default`       | Default scripts, same as `-sC`                                         |
| `discovery`     | Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names |
| `dos`           | Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)                  |
| `exploit`       | Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services                        |
| `external`      | Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal   |
| `fuzzer`        | Launch fuzzing attacks                                                 |
| `intrusive`     | Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation         |
| `malware`       | Scans for backdoors                                                    |
| `safe`          | Safe scripts that won’t crash the target                               |
| `version`       | Retrieve service versions                                              |
| `vuln`          | Checks for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services              |

*Note:*
	Some scripts belong to more than one category. Moreover, some scripts launch brute-force attacks against services, while others launch DoS attacks and exploit systems. Hence, it is crucial to be careful when selecting scripts to run if you don’t want to crash services or exploit them.

The command is `sudo nmap -sS -sC MACHINE_IP`, where `-sC` will ensure that Nmap will execute the default scripts following the SYN scan. There are new details that appear below. Take a look at the SSH service at port **22**; Nmap recovered all four public keys related to the running server. Consider another example, the HTTP service at port 80; Nmap retrieved the default page title.

You can also specify the script by name using `--script "SCRIPT-NAME"` or a pattern such as `--script "ftp*"`, which would include `ftp-brute`.

*Note:*
	You have to be careful as some scripts are pretty intrusive. Moreover, some scripts might be for a specific server and, if chosen at random, will waste your time with no benefit. As usual, make sure that you are authorised to launch such tests on the target server.\

Let’s consider a benign script, `http-date`, which we guess would retrieve the http server date and time, and this is indeed confirmed in its description: “Gets the date from HTTP-like services. Also, it prints how much the date differs from local time…”

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS -n --script "http-date" MACHINE_IP

*Note:*
	You might expand the functionality of Nmap beyond the official Nmap scripts; you can write your script or download Nmap scripts from the Internet. Downloading and using a Nmap script from the Internet holds a certain level of risk. So it is a good idea not to run a script from an author you don’t trust.
