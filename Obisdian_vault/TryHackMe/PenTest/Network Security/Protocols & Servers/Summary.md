Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:
1. Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture);
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack;
3. Password Attack (Authentication Attack);
4. Vulnerabilities.

From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA):
- **Confidentiality** refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties.
- **Integrity** is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination.
- **Availability** refers to being able to access the service when we need it.

Note:
	Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.

These attacks directly affect the security of the system. For instance, network packet capture violates confidentiality and leads to the disclosure of information. A successful password attack can also lead to disclosure. On the other hand, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack breaks the system’s integrity as it can alter the communicated data.

Vulnerabilities are of a broader spectrum, and exploited vulnerabilities have different impacts on the target systems. For instance, exploiting a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can affect the system’s availability, while exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability can lead to more severe damages. It is important to note that a vulnerability by itself creates a risk; damage can occur only when the vulnerability is exploited.

Hydra remains a very efficient tool that you can launch from the terminal to try the different passwords. We summarize its main options in the following table.

|Option|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`-l username`|Provide the login name|
|`-P WordList.txt`|Specify the password list to use|
|`server service`|Set the server address and service to attack|
|`-s PORT`|Use in case of non-default service port number|
|`-V` or `-vV`|Show the username and password combinations being tried|
|`-d`|Display debugging output if the verbose output is not helping|
