## [Severity 1] 
### **Injection**
Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are being used and how exactly the input is interpreted by these technologies. Some common examples include:
- **SQL Injection:** This occurs when user controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. 
		Access, Modify and Delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean that an attacker can steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
- **Command Injection**: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary system commands on application servers.
		Execute Arbitrary system commands on a server that would allow an attacker to gain access to users’ systems. This would enable them to steal sensitive data and carry out more attacks against infrastructure linked to the server on which the command is executed.

The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:
- Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe input or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected and the application throws an error.
- Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these characters are removed before they are processed.

*Note:*
	Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or even just stripping input, there are various libraries that perform these actions for you.

### **OS Command Injection**
Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.  It is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to take advantage of that made system call to execute operating system commands on the server.  Sometimes this won't always end in something malicious, like a `whoami` or just reading of files.  That isn't too bad.  But the thing about command injection is it opens up many options for the attacker.  The worst thing they could do would be to spawn a reverse shell to become the user that the web server is running as.

A simple `;nc -e /bin/bash` is all that's needed and they own your server; some variants of netcat don't support the -e option. You can use a list of [these](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) reverse shells as an alternative.  Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and start looking for ways to pivot around. 

- **How it Happens:**
When a web application or any software program uses user input to create and execute an OS command, there's a risk that an attacker could manipulate this input to execute unintended commands. For example, if a web application takes a filename from a user input field and appends it to a command string to delete a file on the server (`rm filename`), an attacker might enter something like `filename; ls`, which could result in the execution of two commands:
1. `rm filename` (removes the file, as intended)
2. `ls` (lists all files in the directory)

This is a simple example, but the concept extends to more dangerous commands that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or take control of the server.

- **Common Causes:**
1. **Insecure Shell Execution**: When a program uses functions like `system()`, `exec()`, or similar to run shell commands without properly sanitizing or validating inputs.
2. **Concatenating User Input**: Directly appending or injecting user input into OS command strings.
3. **Lack of Input Validation**: Not properly filtering or sanitizing inputs to ensure they don't contain special characters or sequences that could be interpreted as part of a command.

- **Example Scenario:**
Imagine a web application that allows users to check the status of a server by entering a server name:
```
import os 
server_name = input("Enter the server name: ") 
os.system(f"ping {server_name}")
```

If an attacker enters `server_name` as `example.com; rm -rf /`, the application would execute:
`ping example.com; rm -rf /`

This would first ping `example.com`, then execute the devastating command `rm -rf /`, which could delete all files on the system.

***Consequences*:**
- **Data Theft or Loss**: Attackers can steal or delete sensitive data.
- **System Takeover**: Attackers may gain control over the server, leading to further attacks.
- **Denial of Service**: By executing commands that overwhelm the system, attackers can cause the application or server to crash.

***Mitigation* *Strategies*:**
1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated, sanitized, and, if possible, constrained to a specific format or type.
2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Where possible, avoid using functions that directly execute OS commands. Use safer APIs or libraries designed to perform the necessary operations without invoking a shell.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run applications with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful injection.
4. **Escape User Inputs**: If commands must be dynamically constructed, ensure that inputs are properly escaped.
5. **Use Parameterized Functions**: Use functions that separate command and parameters, preventing the user input from being interpreted as part of the command.

#### **Active Command Injection**
- *Blind* command injection occurs when the system command made to the server does not return the response to the user in the HTML document.  
- *Active* command injection will return the response to the user.  It can be made visible through several HTML elements. 

Let's consider a scenario: EvilCorp has started development on a web based shell but has accidentally left it exposed to the Internet.  It's nowhere near finished but contains the same command injection vulnerability as before!  But this time, the response from the system call can be seen on the page:
![[Pasted image 20240808164358.png]]
1. Checking if the parameter "commandString" is set
2. If it is, then the variable `$command_string` gets what was passed into the input field
3. The program then goes into a try block to execute the function `passthru($command_string)`.  You can read the docs on `passthru()` on [PHP's website](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php), but in general, it is executing what gets entered into the input then passing the output directly back to the browser.
4. If the try does not succeed, output the error to page.  Generally this won't output anything because you can't output stderr but PHP doesn't let you have a try without a catch.

- ***Ways to Detect Active Command Injection***
	We know that active command injection occurs when you can see the response from the system call.  In the above code, the function `passthru()` is actually what's doing all of the work here.  It's passing the response directly to the document so you can see the fruits of your labor right there.  Since we know that, we can go over some useful commands to try to enumerate the machine a bit further.  The function call here to `passthru()` may not always be what's happening behind the scenes, but I felt it was the easiest and least complicated way to demonstrate the vulnerability. Commands to try:
	
		Linux
		- whoami
		- id
		- ifconfig/ip addr
		- uname -a
		- ps -ef
		
		Windows
		- whoami
		- ver
		- ipconfig
		- tasklist
		- netstat -an

## [Severity 2] 

### **Broken Authentication**
Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, the server would verify them. If they are correct, the server would then provide the users’ browser with a session cookie. A session cookie is needed because web servers use HTTP(S) to communicate which is stateless. Attaching session cookies means that the server will know who is sending what data. 
  
If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other users’ accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include:
- Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts. 
- Use of weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts. They can do this without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
- Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts.

There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:
- To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy. 
- To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
- Implement Multi Factor Authentication - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.

A lot of times what happens is that developers forgets to sanitize the input(username & password) given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection. However, we are going to focus on a vulnerability that happens because of a developer's mistake but is very easy to exploit i.e re-registration of an existing user.

Let's understand this with the help of an example, say there is an existing user with the name admin and now we want to get access to their account so what we can do is try to re-register that username but with slight modification. We are going to enter `" admin"`(notice the space in the starting). Now when you enter that in the username field and enter other required information like email id or password and submit that data. It will actually register a new user but that user will have the same right as normal admin. That new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user admin.

## [Severity 3]
### **Sensitive Data Exposure** 
When a webapp accidentally divulges sensitive data, we refer to it as "Sensitive Data Exposure". This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc), but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. At more complex levels this often involves techniques such as a "Man in The Middle Attack", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device which they control, then take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to gain access to the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place...). 

#### Sqlite3 - flat database files
The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format that is easily accessible from many locations at once is in a database. In a production environment it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers, running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These databases are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer.

The most common (and simplest) format of flat-file database is an _sqlite_ database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages, and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called "_sqlite3_", and is installed by default on Kali.

To access it we use: `sqlite3 <database-name>`
To see a list of all the tables in the database, use the following command: `.tables`

## [Severity 4] 

### **XML External Entity**
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.  
  
There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).  
1) in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
2) out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a markup language used for storing and transporting data.
	- XML is platform-independent and programming language independent, thus it can be used on any system and supports the technology change when that happens.  
	- The data stored and transported using XML can be changed at any point in time without affecting the data presentation.  
	- XML allows validation using DTD and Schema. This validation ensures that the XML document is free from any syntax error.  
	- XML simplifies data sharing between various systems because of its platform-independent nature. XML data doesn’t require any conversion when transferred between different systems.

Every XML document mostly starts with what is known as XML Prolog.  
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`

Above the line is called XML prolog and it specifies the XML version and the encoding used in the XML document. This line is not compulsory to use but it is considered a `good practice` to put that line in all your XML documents.  
  
Every XML document must contain a `ROOT` element. For example:  
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mail>
   <to>falcon</to>
   <from>feast</from>
   <subject>About XXE</subject>
   <text>Teach about XXE</text>
</mail>
```

In the above example the `<mail>` is the ROOT element of that document and `<to>`, `<from>`, `<subject>`, `<text>` are the children elements. If the XML document doesn't have any root element then it would be considered`wrong` or `invalid` XML doc.

#### DTD
DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. Say we have a file named `note.dtd` with the following content:  

`<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>`

Now we can use this DTD to validate the information of some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.
![[Pasted image 20240811015245.png]]
- !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
- !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
- !ELEMENT to - Defines the `to` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT from - Defines the `from` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the `heading` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT body - Defines the `body` element to be of type "#PCDATA"

    NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.

#### XXE Payload
```
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY name "feast"> ]>     !!!
 <userInfo>  
  <firstName>falcon</firstName>  
  <lastName>&name;</lastName>          !!!
 </userInfo>
```

We can also use XXE to read some file from the system by defining an ENTITY and having it use the SYSTEM keyword:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>
<root>&read;</root>
```

![[Pasted image 20240811024546.png]]

Where is falcon's SSH key located?

## [Severity 5] 

### **Broken Access Control**
Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors, for example only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor is able to access the protected page/pages that they are not authorised to view, the access controls are broken.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages, can lead to the following:
- Being able to view sensitive information
- Accessing unauthorized functionality

OWASP have a listed a few attack scenarios demonstrating access control weaknesses:  

Scenario #1: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
```
pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
```

An attacker simply modifies the ‘acct’ parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want. If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user’s account.
`http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct`

Scenario #2: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.
`http://example.com/app/getappInfo`
`http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo`

#### **IDOR**
IDOR, or Insecure Direct Object Reference, is the act of exploiting a misconfiguration in the way user input is handled, to access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to access. IDOR is a type of access control vulnerability.

For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this [https://example.com/bank?account_number=1234](https://example.com/bank?account_number=1234). On that page we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they needed to do and move along their way thinking nothing is wrong. There is however a potentially huge problem here, a hacker may be able to change the account_number parameter to something else like 1235, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information


## [Severity 6] 

### **Security Misconfiguration**
Security Misconfigurations are distinct from the other Top 10 vulnerabilities, because they occur when security could have been configured properly but was not.  

Security misconfigurations include:
- Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets;
- Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges;
- Default accounts with unchanged passwords;
- Error messages that are overly detailed and allow an attacker to find out more about the system;
- Not using [HTTP security headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/), or revealing too much detail in the Server: HTTP header;

This vulnerability can often lead to more vulnerabilities, such as default credentials giving you access to sensitive data, XXE or command injection on admin pages.

#### Default Passwords
It's particularly common in embedded and Internet of Things devices, and much of the time the owners don't change these passwords.

In October 2016, Dyn (a DNS provider) was taken offline by one of the most memorable DDoS attacks of the past 10 years. The flood of traffic came mostly from Internet of Things and networking devices like routers and modems, infected by the Mirai malware.

How did the malware take over the systems? Default passwords. The malware had a list of 63 username/password pairs, and attempted to log in to exposed telnet services.

The DDoS attack was notable because it took many large websites and services offline. Amazon, Twitter, Netflix, GitHub, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and many more services went offline for several hours in 3 waves of DDoS attacks on Dyn.

## [Severity 7] 

### **Cross-site Scripting**
Cross-site scripting, also known as XSS is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It’s a type of injection which can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts and have it execute on a victim’s machine.
  
A web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input. XSS is possible in Javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS. There are three main types of cross-site scripting:
1. **Stored** XSS - the most dangerous type of XSS. This is where a malicious string originates from the website’s database. This often happens when a website allows user input that is not sanitised (remove the "bad parts" of a users input) when inserted into the database.
2. **Reflected** XSS - the malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website. The website includes this payload in response back to the user. To summarise, an attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload.
3. **DOM-Based** XSS - DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document and this document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
#### **XSS Payloads**
Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that can be exploited to execute malicious Javascript on a victim’s machine. Check out some common payloads types used:
- Popup's (<script>alert(“Hello World”)</script>) - Creates a Hello World message popup on a users browser.
- Writing HTML (document.write) - Override the website's HTML to add your own (essentially defacing the entire page).
- XSS Keylogger (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/simplekeylogger.js.html) - You can log all keystrokes of a user, capturing their password and other sensitive information they type into the webpage.
- Port scanning (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/portscanapi.js.html) - A mini local port scanner 

XSS-Payloads.com (http://www.xss-payloads.com/) is a website that has XSS related Payloads, Tools, Documentation and more. You can download XSS payloads that take snapshots from a webcam or even get a more capable port and network scanner.

- **Reflected XSS**
When you submit anything in the search input, it will appear in the keyword query in your URL.
Remember, the main difference between reflected and dom based xss, is that with reflected xss your payload (string in this case) gets inputted directly into the page. No Javascript is loaded before hand, neither is anything processed in the DOM before hand.

Look at the source code, you will notice your payload is executed directly on the webpage.
`<h6>You searched for: [Your input will be input directly in here]</h6>`

This means any user input that is not sanatised will be executed.

*Note:*
	Some browsers have in-built XSS protection. Use FireFox and complete the following steps:
	- Go to the URL bar, type `about:config`
    - Search for `browser.urlbar.filter.javascript`
    - Change the boolean value from `True` to `False`


## [Severity 8]
### **Insecure Deserialization**
_"Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application" (Acunetix., 2017)  

This definition is still quite broad to say the least. Simply, insecure deserialization is replacing data processed by an application with malicious code; allowing anything from DoS (Denial of Service) to RCE (Remote Code Execution) that the attacker can use to gain a foothold in a pentesting scenario.

Specifically, this malicious code leverages the legitimate serialization and deserialization process used by web applications. We'll be explaining this process and why it is so commonplace in modern web applications.

_OWASP rank this vulnerability as 8 out of 10 because of the following reasons_:

- Low exploitability. This vulnerability is often a case-by-case basis - there is no reliable tool/framework for it. Because of its nature, attackers need to have a good understanding of the inner-workings of the ToE.
- The exploit is only as dangerous as the attacker's skill permits, more so, the value of the data that is exposed. For example, someone who can only cause a DoS will make the application unavailable. The business impact of this will vary on the infrastructure - some organisations will recover just fine, others, however, will not.

Any application that stores or fetches data where there are no validations or integrity checks in place for the data queried or retained. A few examples of applications of this nature are:
- E-Commerce Sites  
- Forums  
- API's  
- Application Runtimes (Tomcat, Jenkins, Jboss, etc)

#### **Serialisation**
Serialisation is the process of converting objects used in programming into simpler, compatible formatting for transmitting between systems or networks for further processing or storage.

Alternatively, deserialisation is the reverse of this; converting serialised information into their complex form - an object that the application will understand.

Say you have a password of "password123" from a program that needs to be stored in a database on another system. To travel across a network this string/output needs to be converted to binary. Of course, the password needs to be stored as "password123" and not its binary notation. Once this reaches the database, it is converted or deserialised back into "password123" so it can be stored. 
![[Pasted image 20240812034542.png]]

Simply, insecure deserialization occurs when data from an untrusted party (I.e. a hacker) gets executed because there is no filtering or input validation; the system assumes that the data is trustworthy and will execute it no holds barred.

### **Cookies**
Websites use these cookies to store user-specific behaviours like items in their shopping cart or session IDs. 

![[Pasted image 20240812034830.png]]

*Note:*
	Whilst plaintext credentials is a vulnerability in itself, it is not insecure deserialization as we have not sent any serialized data to be executed!

Cookies are not permanent storage solutions like databases. Some cookies such as session ID's will clear when the browser is closed, others, however, last considerably longer. This is determined by the "Expiry" timer that is set when the cookie is created.

| Attribute    | Description                                                             | Required? |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Cookie Name  | The Name of the Cookie to be set                                        | Yes       |
| Cookie Value | Value, this can be anything plaintext or encoded                        | Yes       |
| Secure Only  | If set, this cookie will only be set over HTTPS connections             | No        |

Cookies can be set in various website programming languages. For example, Javascript, PHP or Python to name a few. The following web application is developed using Python's Flask, so it is fitting to use it as an example:

This snippet gets the current date and time, stores it within the variable "timestamp" and then stores the date and time in a cookie named "registrationTimestamp". This is what it will look like in the browser:

## [Severity 9] 
### **Components With Known Vulnerabilities** 
Occasionally, you may find that the company/entity that you're pen-testing is using a program that already has a well documented vulnerability.

For example, let's say that a company hasn't updated their version of WordPress for a few years, and using a tool such as wpscan, you find that it's version 4.6. Some quick research will reveal that WordPress 4.6 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution(RCE) exploit, and even better you can find an exploit already made on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41962).

As you can see this would be quite devastating, because it requires very little work on the part of the attacker as often times since the vulnerability is already well known, someone else has made an exploit for the vulnerability. The situation becomes even worse when you realize, that it's really quite easy for this to happen, if a company misses a single update for a program they use, they could be vulnerable to any number of attacks.

Hence, why OWASP has rated this a 3(meaning high) on the prevalence scale, it is incredibly easy for a company to miss an update for an application.

## [Severity 10] 
### **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because in the event of an incident, the attackers actions can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions an attacker performed if they gain access to particular web applications. 

The bigger impacts of these include:
- regulatory damage: if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, not only are users of the application affected, but the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.
- risk of further attacks: without logging, the presence of an attacker may be undetected. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.

The information stored in logs should include:
- HTTP status codes
- Time Stamps
- Usernames
- API endpoints/page locations
- IP addresses

Logging is more important after a breach or incident has occurred. The ideal case is having monitoring in place to detect any suspicious activity. The aim of detecting this suspicious activity is to either stop the attacker completely or reduce the impact they've made if their presence has been detected much later than anticipated. 

Common examples of suspicious activity includes:
- multiple unauthorised attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorised resources e.g. admin pages)
- requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.
- use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate an attacker is using automated tooling.
- common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use Cross Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorised/malicious testing on applications.

*Note:*
	Just detecting suspicious activity isn't helpful. This suspicious activity needs to be rated according to the impact level. For example, certain actions will higher impact than others. These higher impact actions need to be responded to sooner thus they should raise an alarm which raises the attention of the relevant party.
