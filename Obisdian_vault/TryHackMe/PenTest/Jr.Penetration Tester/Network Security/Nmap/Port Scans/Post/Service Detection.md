Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service.

Adding `-sV` to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. 

You can control the intensity with `--version-intensity LEVEL` where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. `-sV --version-light` has an intensity of 2, while `-sV --version-all` has an intensity of 9.

*Note:*
	It is important to note that using `-sV` will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan `-sS` is not possible when `-sV` option is chosen.

Adding the `-sV` option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of `22/tcp open ssh`, we obtain `22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0)`
