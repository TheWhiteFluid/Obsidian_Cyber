UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence it *does not require any handshake* for connection establishment.

 If a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned.
	  You can select UDP scan using the `-sU` option; moreover, you can combine it with another TCP scan.
