In the same sense that an IP address specifies a host on a network among many others, a TCP port or UDP port is used to identify a network service running on that host.

 A port is usually linked to a service using that specific port number: for instance, an HTTP server would bind to TCP port 80 by default; moreover, if the HTTP server supports SSL/TLS, it would listen on TCP port 443.
 
We can classify ports in two states:
	a) Open port indicates that there is some service listening on that port.
	b) Closed port indicates that there is no service listening on that port.

However, in practical situations, we need to consider the impact of firewalls. Therefore, Nmap considers the following six states:
1. *Open*: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
2. *Closed*: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
3. *Filtered*: means that Nmap ***cannot determine*** if the port is open or closed because the port is ***not accessible.*** This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
4. *Unfiltered*: means that Nmap ***cannot determine*** if the port is open or closed, although the port ***is accessible***. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan `-sA`.
5. *Open|Filtered*: This means that Nmap ***cannot determine*** whether the port is open or filtered.
6. *Closed|Filtered*: This means that Nmap ***cannot decide*** whether a port is closed or filtered.
