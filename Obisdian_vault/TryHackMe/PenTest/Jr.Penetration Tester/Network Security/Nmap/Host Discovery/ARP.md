There are various ways to discover online hosts. When no host discovery options are provided, Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:
1. When a **_privileged_ user** tries to scan targets on a **local network** (Ethernet), Nmap uses **_ARP requests_**. A privileged user is `root` or a user who belongs to `sudoers` and can run `sudo`.
2. When a **_privileged_ user** tries to scan targets **outside** the local network, Nmap uses **ICMP echo** requests, **TCP ACK** (Acknowledge) to port **80**, **TCP SYN** (Synchronize) to port **443**, and ICMP timestamp request.
3. When an **_unprivileged_ user** tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a **TCP 3-way handshake** by sending **SYN** packets to ports **80 and 443**.

 If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue `nmap -sn TARGETS`
 
ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. 

The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields. To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. 

If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use `nmap -PR -sn TARGETS`, where `-PR` indicates that you only want an ARP scan.
