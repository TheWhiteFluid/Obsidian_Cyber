Email is one of the most used services on the Internet. There are various configurations for email servers; for instance, you may set up an email system to allow local users to exchange emails with each other with no access to the Internet. However, we will consider the more general setup where different email servers connect over the Internet.

Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:
1. Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
2. Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
3. Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
4. Mail User Agent (MUA)

Consider the following analogy:
1. You (MUA) want to send postal mail.
2. The post office employee (MSA) checks the postal mail for any issues before your local post office (MTA) accepts it.
3. The local post office checks the mail destination and sends it to the post office (MTA) in the correct country.
4. The post office (MTA) delivers the mail to the recipient mailbox (MDA).
5. The recipient (MUA) regularly checks the mailbox for new mail. They notice the new mail, and they take it.

In the same way, we need to follow a protocol to communicate with an HTTP server, and we need to rely on email protocols to talk with an MTA and an MDA. The protocols are:
1. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
2. Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to communicate with an MTA server. Because SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption, we can use a basic Telnet client to connect to an SMTP server and act as an email client (MUA) sending a message.

SMTP server listens on port 25 by default. To see basic communication with an SMTP server, we used Telnet to connect to it. Once connected, we issue `helo hostname` and then start typing our email.

After `helo`, we issue `mail from:`, `rcpt to:` to indicate the sender and the recipient. When we send our email message, we issue the command `data` and type our message:
```shell-session
