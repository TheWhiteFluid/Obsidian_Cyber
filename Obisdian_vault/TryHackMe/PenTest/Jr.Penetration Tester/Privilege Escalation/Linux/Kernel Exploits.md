Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access. Unless a single vulnerability leads to a root shell, the privilege escalation process will rely on misconfigurations and lax permissions.

The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;
1. Identify the kernel version;
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system;
3. Run the exploit;

*Note:*
	Please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.

*Hints:*
1. Being too specific about the kernel version when searching for exploits on Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit
2. Be sure you understand how the exploit code works BEFORE you launch it. Some exploit codes can make changes on the operating system that would make them unsecured in further use or make irreversible changes to the system, creating problems later. Of course, these may not be great concerns within a lab or CTF environment, but these are absolute no-nos during a real penetration testing engagement.
3. Some exploits may require further interaction once they are run. Read all comments and instructions provided with the exploit code.
4. You can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the `SimpleHTTPServer` Python module and `wget` respectively.
   
   
### **Examples**
Q) Find and use the appropriate kernel exploit to gain root privileges on the target system.

To pull the exploit code into the target file via wget, send it to `/tmp`, since it can run on the exploit file you want there.

 Running the command `gcc exploit.c -o exploit` will create an executable named `exploit`.
