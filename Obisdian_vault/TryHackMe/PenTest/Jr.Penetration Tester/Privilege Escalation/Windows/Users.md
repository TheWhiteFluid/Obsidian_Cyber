Windows systems mainly have two kinds of users. Depending on their access levels, we can categories a user in one of the following groups:
- **Administrators**: These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.
- **Standard Users**: These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files.

Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the **Administrators** group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the **Users** group. In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:
- **SYSTEM / LocalSystem**: 
An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.  
- **Local Service**:
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.  
- **Network Service**:  
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.\

*Note:*
	These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.
