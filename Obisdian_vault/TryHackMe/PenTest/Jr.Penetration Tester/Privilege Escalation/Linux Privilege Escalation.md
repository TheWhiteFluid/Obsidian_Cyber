Privilege escalation is a journey. There are no silver bullets, and much depends on the specific configuration of the target system. The kernel version, installed applications, supported programming languages, other users' passwords are a few key elements that will affect your road to the root shell.  

**What does "privilege escalation" mean?**
At it's core, Privilege Escalation usually involves going from a lower permission account to a higher permission one. More technically, it's the exploitation of a vulnerability, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain unauthorized access to resources that are usually restricted from the users.  
  
It's rare when performing a real-world penetration test to be able to gain a foothold (initial access) that gives you direct administrative access. Privilege escalation is crucial because it lets you gain system administrator levels of access, which allows you to perform actions such as:
- Resetting passwords;  
- Bypassing access controls to compromise protected data;
- Editing software configurations;
- Enabling persistence;
- Changing the privilege of existing (or new) users;
- Execute any administrative command;
  
## **Enumeration**
Enumeration is the first step you have to take once you gain access to any system. You may have accessed the system by exploiting a critical vulnerability that resulted in root-level access or just found a way to send commands using a low privileged account. Penetration testing engagements, unlike CTF machines, don't end once you gain access to a specific system or user privilege level. As you will see, enumeration is as important during the post-compromise phase as it is before.

### #hostname
The `hostname` command will return the hostname of the target machine. Although this value can easily be changed or have a relatively meaningless string (e.g. Ubuntu-3487340239), in some cases, it can provide information about the target system’s role within the corporate network (e.g. SQL-PROD-01 for a production SQL server).

	![[Pasted image 20240821161939.png]]
### #uname -a
Will print system information giving us additional detail about the kernel used by the system. This will be useful when searching for any potential kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.
	![[Pasted image 20240821162011.png]]
### #/proc/version
The proc filesystem (procfs) provides information about the target system processes. You will find proc on many different Linux flavours, making it an essential tool to have in your arsenal.

Looking at `/proc/version` may give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed.
	![[Pasted image 20240821171940.png]]
### #/etc/issue
Systems can also be identified by looking at the `/etc/issue` file. This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be customized or changed. While on the subject, any file containing system information can be customized or changed. For a clearer understanding of the system, it is always good to look at all of these.

	![[Pasted image 20240821172132.png]]
### #ps 
The `ps` command is an effective way to see the running processes on a Linux system. Typing `ps` on your terminal will show processes for the current shell.

	![[Pasted image 20240821172211.png]]
The output of the `ps` (Process Status) will show the following;
- **PID**: The process ID (unique to the process)
- **TTY**: Terminal type used by the user
- **Time**: Amount of CPU time used by the process (this is NOT the time this process has been running for)
- **CMD**: The command or executable running (will NOT display any command line parameter)

The “ps” command provides a few useful options.
- `ps -A`: View all running processes
- `ps aux`: The `aux` option will show processes for all users (a), display the user that launched the process (u), and show processes that are not attached to a terminal (x). Looking at the ps aux command output, we can have a better understanding of the system and potential vulnerabilities.
- `ps axjf`: View process tree (see the tree formation until `ps axjf` is run below)
	![[Pasted image 20240821044152.png]]

### #env
The `env` command will show environmental variables.
The PATH variable may have a compiler or a scripting language (e.g. Python) that could be used to run code on the target system or leveraged for privilege escalation.
	![[Pasted image 20240821044338.png]]

### #sudo -l
The target system may be configured to allow users to run some (or all) commands with root privileges. The `sudo -l` command can be used to list all commands your user can run using `sudo`.

### **ls**
While looking for potential privilege escalation vectors, please remember to always use the `ls` command with the `-la` parameter. The example below shows how the “secret.txt” file can easily be missed using the `ls` or `ls -l` commands.
	![[Pasted image 20240821172404.png]]

### **Id**
The `id` command will provide a general overview of the user’s privilege level and group memberships. It is worth remembering that the `id` command can also be used to obtain the same information for another user as seen below.
	![[Pasted image 20240821172449.png]]

### #/etc/passwd
Reading the `/etc/passwd` file can be an easy way to discover users on the system.
	![[Pasted image 20240821172526.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240821172546.png]]

*Note:*
	Remember that this will return all users, some of which are system or service users that would not be very useful. Another approach could be to `grep` for “home” as real users will most likely have their folders under the “home” directory.
	
	![[Pasted image 20240821172635.png]]

### #history
Looking at earlier commands with the `history` command can give us some idea about the target system and, albeit rarely, have stored information such as passwords or usernames

### #ifconfig
The target system may be a pivoting point to another network. The `ifconfig` command will give us information about the network interfaces of the system. The example below shows the target system has three interfaces (eth0, tun0, and tun1). Our attacking machine can reach the eth0 interface but can not directly access the two other networks.

This can be confirmed using the `ip route` command to see which network routes exist.
	![[Pasted image 20240821172821.png]]

### #netstat
Following an initial check for existing interfaces and network routes, it is worth looking into existing communications. The `netstat` command can be used with several different options to gather information on existing connections.
- `netstat -a`: shows all listening ports and established connections.
- `netstat -at` or `netstat -au` can also be used to list TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
- `netstat -l`: list ports in “listening” mode. These ports are open and ready to accept incoming connections. This can be used with the “t” option to list only ports that are listening using the TCP protocol (below)
	  ![[Pasted image 20240821172902.png]]
	  
- `netstat -s`: list network usage statistics by protocol (below) This can also be used with the `-t` or `-u` options to limit the output to a specific protocol.
		![[Pasted image 20240821172957.png]]
		
- `netstat -tp`: list connections with the service name and PID information.
		![[Pasted image 20240821173041.png]]
		This can also be used with the `-l` option to list listening ports (below)![[Pasted image 20240821173116.png]]
		
- `netstat -i`: Shows interface statistics. We see below that “eth0” and “tun0” are more active than “tun1”.
		  ![[Pasted image 20240821173151.png]]

The `netstat` usage you will probably see most often in blog posts, write-ups, and courses is `netstat -ano` which could be broken down as follows;
- `-a`: Display all sockets
- `-n`: Do not resolve names
- `-o`: Display timers
	![[Pasted image 20240821173356.png]]

### #find 
Searching the target system for important information and potential privilege escalation vectors can be fruitful.

**Find files:**
- `find . -name flag1.txt`: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
- `find /home -name flag1.txt`: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
- `find / -type d -name config`: find the directory named config under “/”
- `find / -type f -perm 0777`: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
- `find / -perm a=x`: find executable files
- `find /home -user frank`: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
- `find / -mtime 10`: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
- `find / -atime 10`: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
- `find / -cmin -60`: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -amin -60`: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -size 50M`: find files with a 50 MB size

The example above returns files that are larger than 100 MB. It is important to note that the “find” command tends to generate errors which sometimes makes the output hard to read. This is why it would be wise to use the “find” command with `-type f 2>/dev/null` to redirect errors to “/dev/null” and have a cleaner output (below).
	![[Pasted image 20240821173637.png]]

Folders and files that can be written to or executed from:
- `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null` : Find world-writeable folders
- `find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null`: Find world-writeable folders
- `find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null`: Find world-writeable folders
- `find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null` : Find world-executable folders

Find development tools and supported languages:
- `find / -name perl*`
- `find / -name python*`
- `find / -name gcc*`

Find specific file permissions:
- `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`: Find files with the SUID bit, which allows us to run the file with a higher privilege level than the current user.

### #locate
The `locate` command is used to quickly find the locations of files on your system.

- **How it works:** `locate` searches through a database of file paths that is created by the `updatedb` command. This database contains a snapshot of your filesystem, allowing `locate` to find files much faster than using a command like `find`, which searches the filesystem directly.

    `locate filename`
    
    This will return a list of paths that match the provided filename.

### #grep
The `grep` command is used to search text or files for lines that match a specified pattern.

- **How it works:** `grep` searches through the content of files line by line, matching each line against the pattern you provide.

    `grep "pattern" filename`
    
    This will print all lines in `filename` that contain the `pattern`.
    
- **Example:**
    `grep "error" /var/log/syslog`
    
    This will search for the word "error" in the system log file.
    
- **Common options:**
    - `-i`: Ignore case (case-insensitive search).
    - `-r`: Recursively search directories.
    - `-n`: Show line numbers where matches are found.
    - `-v`: Invert the match, showing lines that do not match the pattern.

### #cut
The `cut` command is used to extract specific sections from each line of a file or stream of text.

- **How it works:** `cut` can split each line into fields based on a delimiter (e.g., a space or comma) and then extract one or more fields from each line.
    `cut -d "delimiter" -f field_number filename`
    
    - `-d "delimiter"` specifies the delimiter used to separate fields.
    - `-f field_number` specifies which field(s) to extract.
- **Example:**
    `cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd`
    
    This will extract the first field from each line in `/etc/passwd`, where fields are separated by colons (`:`). In this case, it will display usernames.
    
- **Common options:**
    - `-b`: Extract specific bytes.
    - `-c`: Extract specific characters.
    - `-f`: Extract specific fields based on a delimiter.

### **sort**
The `sort` command is used to sort lines of text files or input streams.

- **How it works:** `sort` reads input line by line, compares them, and then outputs the lines in sorted order. The default is to sort alphabetically, but it can also sort numerically, by month, etc.

    `sort filename`
    
    This will sort the lines in `filename` alphabetically.
    
    `sort numbers.txt`
    
    This will sort the contents of `numbers.txt` in ascending order.
    
- **Common options:**
    - `-r`: Reverse the sort order (descending).
    - `-n`: Sort numerically.
    - `-k`: Sort by a specific key (column).
    - `-t`: Specify a field delimiter for sorting.


## **Automated Enumeration Tools**
Several tools can help you save time during the enumeration process. These tools should only be used to save time knowing they may miss some privilege escalation vectors. Below is a list of popular Linux enumeration tools with links to their respective Github repositories.

- **Linux Smart Enumeration:** [https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration)

## **Privilege Escalation: Kernel Exploits**
Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access.

Unless a single vulnerability leads to a root shell, the privilege escalation process will rely on misconfigurations and lax permissions.

The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;
1. Identify the kernel version;
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system;
3. Run the exploit;

*Note:*
	Please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.

*Hints:*
1. Being too specific about the kernel version when searching for exploits on Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit
2. Be sure you understand how the exploit code works BEFORE you launch it. Some exploit codes can make changes on the operating system that would make them unsecured in further use or make irreversible changes to the system, creating problems later. Of course, these may not be great concerns within a lab or CTF environment, but these are absolute no-nos during a real penetration testing engagement.
3. Some exploits may require further interaction once they are run. Read all comments and instructions provided with the exploit code.
4. You can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the `SimpleHTTPServer` Python module and `wget` respectively.

Q) Find and use the appropriate kernel exploit to gain root privileges on the target system.
	![[Pasted image 20240822021207.png]]\

Q)What is the content of the flag1.txt file?
	![[Pasted image 20240822021346.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240822021411.png]]
	
To pull the exploit code into the target file via wget, send it to `/tmp`, since it can run on the exploit file you want there.
	![[Pasted image 20240822021519.png]]

Now we will try to run this code using the command  `gcc exploit.c -o exploit`

If you have a simple C program like this in `exploit.c`:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Running the command `gcc exploit.c -o exploit` will create an executable named `exploit`. 

You can then run it with: `./exploit`

	![[Pasted image 20240822021646.png]]

## **Privilege Escalation: Sudo**
The sudo command, by default, allows you to run a program with root privileges. Under some conditions, system administrators may need to give regular users some flexibility on their privileges. For example, a junior SOC analyst may need to use Nmap regularly but would not be cleared for full root access. In this situation, the system administrator can allow this user to only run Nmap with root privileges while keeping its regular privilege level throughout the rest of the system. Any user can check its current situation related to root privileges using the `sudo -l` command.

- [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is a valuable source that provides information on how any program, on which you may have sudo rights, can be used.

**a) Leverage application functions**  
Some applications will not have a known exploit within this context. Such an application you may see is the Apache2 server.

In this case, we can use a "hack" to leak information leveraging a function of the application. As you can see below, Apache2 has an option that supports loading alternative configuration files (`-f` : specify an alternate ServerConfigFile). Loading the `/etc/shadow` file using this option will result in an error message that includes the first line of the `/etc/shadow` file.
	![[Pasted image 20240822024427.png]]

**b) Leverage LD_PRELOAD**
On some systems, you may see the LD_PRELOAD environment option. LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use shared libraries. If the "env_keep" option is enabled we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.

	![[Pasted image 20240822024543.png]]

The steps of this privilege escalation vector can be summarized as follows:
1. Check for LD_PRELOAD (with the env_keep option)
2. Write a simple C code compiled as a share object (.so extension) file
3. Save this code as shell.c and compile it using gcc into a shared object file using the following parameters:  `gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles`
4. Run the program with sudo rights and the LD_PRELOAD option pointing to our .so file: `sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/ldpreload/shell.so find`

Q) What is the hash of frank's password?
![[Pasted image 20240823202045.png]]

## **Privilege Escalation: SUID**
Much of Linux privilege controls rely on controlling the users and files interactions. This is done with permissions. By now, you know that files can have read, write, and execute permissions. These are given to users within their privilege levels. This changes with SUID (Set-user Identification) and SGID (Set-group Identification). These allow files to be executed with the permission level of the file owner or the group owner, respectively.  
  
You will notice these files have an “s” bit set showing their special permission level.

`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null` will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.
	![[Pasted image 20240823202311.png]]

The SUID bit set for the nano text editor allows us to create, edit and read files using the file owner’s privilege. Nano is owned by root, which probably means that we can read and edit files at a higher privilege level than our current user has. At this stage, we have two basic options for privilege escalation: 
- reading the `/etc/shadow` file 
- adding our user to `/etc/passwd`.

- **reading the `/etc/shadow` file**  
We see that the nano text editor has the SUID bit set by running the `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null` command.   `nano /etc/shadow` will print the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file. 

We can use the unshadow tool to create a file crackable by John the Ripper. To achieve this, unshadow needs both the `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd` files.

	`unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt`  

![](https://i.imgur.com/6cHBAr1.png)

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwords.txt`

Q) Which user shares the name of a great comic book writer?

Q) What is the password of user2?
	```base64 /etc/shadow | base64 -decode```
	`unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt`
	`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwords.txt`
	![[Pasted image 20240823223330.png]]

Q)What is the content of the flag3.txt file?
	same trick on encoding and decoding to gain read acces: 
		`base64 /home/ubuntu/flag3.txt | base64 -d`

## **Privilege Escalation: Capabilities**
Another method system administrators can use to increase the privilege level of a process or binary is “Capabilities”. Capabilities help manage privileges at a more granular level. For example, if the SOC analyst needs to use a tool that needs to initiate socket connections, a regular user would not be able to do that. If the system administrator does not want to give this user higher privileges, they can change the capabilities of the binary. As a result, the binary would get through its task without needing a higher privilege user. The capabilities man page provides detailed information on its usage and options.

We can use the `getcap` tool to list enabled capabilities.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/Q6XYr0p.png)

  
Please note that neither vim nor its copy has the SUID bit set. This privilege escalation vector is therefore not discoverable when enumerating files looking for SUID.
	![[Pasted image 20240823233354.png]]

GTFObins has a good list of binaries that can be leveraged for privilege escalation if we find any set capabilities. Vim can be used with the following command and payload:
	![[Pasted image 20240823234405.png]]
	
	![[Pasted image 20240823233458.png]]

This will launch a root shell as seen below;

Q)What is the content of the flag4.txt file?
	![[Pasted image 20240823235241.png]]

## **Privilege Escalation: Cron Jobs**
Cron jobs are used to run scripts or binaries at specific times. By default, they run with the privilege of their owners and not the current user. While properly configured cron jobs are not inherently vulnerable, they can provide a privilege escalation vector under some conditions.  
The idea is quite simple; if there is a scheduled task that runs with root privileges and we can change the script that will be run, then our script will run with root privileges.  
  
Cron job configurations are stored as crontabs (cron tables) to see the next time and date the task will run.  
  
Each user on the system have their crontab file and can run specific tasks whether they are logged in or not. As you can expect, our goal will be to find a cron job set by root and have it run our script, ideally a shell.  
  
Any user can read the file keeping system-wide cron jobs under `/etc/crontab`
	![[Pasted image 20240824004958.png]]

You can see the `backup.sh` script was configured to run every minute. The content of the file shows a simple script that creates a backup of the prices.xls file.
	![[Pasted image 20240824005024.png]]

As our current user can access this script, we can easily modify it to create a reverse shell, hopefully with root privileges.  The script will use the tools available on the target system to launch a reverse shell. Two points to note:
1. The command syntax will vary depending on the available tools. (e.g. `nc` will probably not support the `-e` option you may have seen used in other cases).
2. We should always prefer to start reverse shells, as we not want to compromise the system integrity during a real penetration testing engagement.

	![[Pasted image 20240824005130.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240824005143.png]]

Crontab is always worth checking as it can sometimes lead to easy privilege escalation vectors. The following scenario is not uncommon in companies that do not have a certain cyber security maturity level:
1. System administrators need to run a script at regular intervals.
2. They create a cron job to do this
3. After a while, the script becomes useless, and they delete it  
4. They do not clean the relevant cron job

This change management issue leads to a potential exploit leveraging cron jobs.
	![[Pasted image 20240824005207.png]]

The example above shows a similar situation where the antivirus.sh script was deleted, but the cron job still exists.  If the full path of the script is not defined (as it was done for the backup.sh script), cron will refer to the paths listed under the PATH variable in the /etc/crontab file. In this case, we should be able to create a script named “antivirus.sh” under our user’s home folder and it should be run by the cron job.

*Note:*
	In the odd event you find an existing script or task attached to a cron job, it is always worth spending time to understand the function of the script and how any tool is used within the context. For example, `tar`, `7z`, `rsync`, etc., can be exploited using their wildcard feature.

Some utilities can be tricked into executing malicious commands if wildcards (`*`, `?`, etc.) are used without caution. Here's how this might happen with some common tools:
#### 1. **`tar` Exploitation**
- **Scenario**: A cron job uses `tar` to archive files in a directory.
- **Exploit**: If you can create files in that directory, you might create a file with a name like `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh` and `shell.sh` containing the commands you want to execute. When `tar` processes this file, it will execute the commands in `shell.sh` as part of its operation.
- **Mitigation**: Always use `--` to indicate the end of command options in `tar` and sanitize input filenames.

	`echo "malicious_code" > shell.sh touch -- '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh'`

#### 2. **`7z` Exploitation**
- **Scenario**: A cron job uses `7z` to compress files.
- **Exploit**: Similar to `tar`, if `7z` is used in a way that allows user-controlled filenames, you might trick it into executing arbitrary commands by injecting special filenames.
- **Mitigation**: Carefully handle filenames and avoid passing unsanitized input directly to `7z`.

#### 3. **`rsync` Exploitation**
- **Scenario**: A cron job uses `rsync` to synchronize files between directories or systems.
- **Exploit**: If you can control the files being synchronized, you might create a file named like `--rsh=command_to_run`. `rsync` might interpret this as an option rather than a filename, potentially allowing code execution.
- **Mitigation**: Use `--` to separate file names from options and validate inputs.

	`touch -- '--rsh=sh malicious_script.sh'`


Q) How many user-defined cron jobs can you see on the target system?
	![[Pasted image 20240824011016.png]]
	
Q) What is the content of the flag5.txt file?
- navigating trough the crontabs we see dat test.py file is deleted so now we can create our own with reverse shell payload included and we need to set permission via chmod 777 (r/w/x)

Q) What is Matt's password?
- /etc/passwd (matt row)
- /etc/shadow (matt row)

## **Privilege Escalation: PATH**
If a folder for which your user has write permission is located in the path, you could potentially hijack an application to run a script. PATH in Linux is an environmental variable that tells the operating system where to search for executables. For any command that is not built into the shell or that is not defined with an absolute path, Linux will start searching in folders defined under PATH. (PATH is the environmental variable we're talking about here, path is the location of a file).

If we type “thm” to the command line, these are the locations Linux will look in for an executable called thm. The scenario below will give you a better idea of how this can be leveraged to increase our privilege level. As you will see, this depends entirely on the existing configuration of the target system, so be sure you can answer the questions below before trying this.
1. What folders are located under $PATH
2. Does your current user have write privileges for any of these folders?
3. Can you modify $PATH?
4. Is there a script/application you can start that will be affected by this vulnerability?


A simple search for writable folders can done using the “`find / -writable 2>/dev/null`” command. The output of this command can be cleaned using a simple cut and sort sequence.

Comparing this with PATH will help us find folders we could use.
	![[Pasted image 20240824015830.png]]

Let's say that we find a script file in one of the directories:
	![[Pasted image 20240824020417.png]]

This script tries to launch a system binary called “thm” but the example can easily be replicated with any binary. We compile this into an executable and set the SUID bit.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/A6QQ65I.png)
	Our user now has access to the “path” script with SUID bit set.

Once executed “path” will look for an executable named “thm” inside folders listed under PATH.
If any writable folder is listed under PATH we could create a binary named thm under that directory and have our “path” script run it. As the SUID bit is set, this binary will run with root privilege.

We see a number of folders under /usr, thus it could be easier to run our writable folder search once more to cover subfolders.  Unfortunately, subfolders under /usr are not writable.

The folder that will be easier to write to is probably /tmp. At this point because /tmp is not present in PATH so we will need to add it. As we can see below, the “`export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`” command accomplishes this.
	![[Pasted image 20240824015928.png]]

At this point the path script will also look under the /tmp folder for an executable named “thm”. Creating this command is fairly easy by copying /bin/bash as “thm” under the /tmp folder.
	![[Pasted image 20240824020032.png]]

We have given executable rights to our copy of /bin/bash, please note that at this point it will run with our user’s right. What makes a privilege escalation possible within this context is that the path script runs with root privileges.

Q)What is the odd folder you have write access for?
- `echo $PATH`
- `find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | sort -u`

Q)Exploit the $PATH vulnerability to read the content of the flag6.txt file.
	![[Pasted image 20240824021557.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240824021755.png]]

- creating the thm that thm.py use and we are adding our exploit: `sudo su-` to gain root privilegies to acces matt files from home directory.
- we have to set chmod 777 to our thm created file and add it's path to the $PATH variable.
  `export PATH=/home/murdoch:$PATH`

## **Privilege Escalation: NFS**
Privilege escalation vectors are not confined to internal access. Shared folders and remote management interfaces such as SSH and Telnet can also help you gain root access on the target system. Some cases will also require using both vectors, e.g. finding a root SSH private key on the target system and connecting via SSH with root privileges instead of trying to increase your current user’s privilege level.

Another vector that is more relevant to CTFs and exams is a misconfigured network shell. This vector can sometimes be seen during penetration testing engagements when a network backup system is present.

NFS (Network File Sharing) configuration is kept in the `/etc/exports` file. This file is created during the NFS server installation and can usually be read by users.
	![[Pasted image 20240825201119.png]]

The critical element for this privilege escalation vector is the `“no_root_squash`” option you can see above. By default, NFS will change the root user to nfsnobody and strip any file from operating with root privileges. If the “`no_root_squash`” option is present on a writable share, we can create an executable with SUID bit set and run it on the target system.

We will start by enumerating mountable shares from our attacking machine.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/CmXPDcv.png)

We will mount one of the “`no_root_squash`” shares to our attacking machine and start building our executable.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/DwAB1qs.png)

As we can set SUID bits, a simple executable that will run /bin/bash on the target system will do the job.
	![[Pasted image 20240825223435.png]]

Once we compile the code we will set the SUID bit
	![[Pasted image 20240825223511.png]]

You will see below that both files (nfs.c and nfs are present on the target system. We have worked on the mounted share so there was no need to transfer them). Notice the nfs executable has the SUID bit set on the target system and runs with root privileges.
	![[Pasted image 20240825223538.png]]

Q)How many mountable shares can you identify on the target system?
	![[Pasted image 20240825230634.png]]

Q)How many shares have the "no_root_squash" option enabled?
	![[Pasted image 20240825230536.png]]


Q)Gain a root shell on the target system
	- using our attaching machine -> display mountable directories of the target machine 
	- create a temporary directory named temp in /tmp
	- mount one of the no_root_squash directory on our machine inside of /tmp/temp directory
	- create a payload(/bin/bash reverse shell in C) that will be distributed trough NFS 
	- set SUID bit permission to the payload file from our attacking machine
	- run payload on the target machine --> root acces

## **Practice: Capstone Challenge**
You have gained SSH access to a large scientific facility. Try to elevate your privileges until you are Root.

Q) unshadow /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow for hashes --> john the ripper for root credentials
Q) gaining root acces using find command --> `sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \;  -quit` (https://gtfobins.github.io/)
