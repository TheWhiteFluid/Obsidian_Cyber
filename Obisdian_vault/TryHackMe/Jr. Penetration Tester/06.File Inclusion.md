In some scenarios, web applications are written to request access to files on a given system, including images, static text, and so on via parameters. Parameters are query parameter strings attached to the URL that could be used to retrieve data or perform actions based on user input. The following diagram breaks down the essential parts of a URL.

**Why do File inclusion vulnerabilities happen?**
File inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly found and exploited in various programming languages for web applications, such as PHP that are poorly written and implemented. The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated, and the user controls them. When the input is not validated, the user can pass any input to the function, causing the vulnerability.

## Path Traversal
Also known as Directory traversal, a web security vulnerability allows an attacker to read operating system resources, such as local files on the server running an application. The attacker exploits this vulnerability by manipulating and abusing the web application's URL to locate and access files or directories stored outside the application's root directory.

Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when the user's input is passed to a function such as `file_get_contents` in PHP. It's important to note that the function is not the main contributor to the vulnerability. Often poor input validation or filtering is the cause of the vulnerability. In PHP, you can use the `file_get_contents` to read the content of a file. You can find more information about the function [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php).

The following graph shows how a web application stores files in `/var/www/app`. The happy path would be the user requesting the contents of **userCV.pdf** from a defined path `/var/www/app/CVs.`

We can test out the URL parameter by adding payloads to see how the web application behaves. Path traversal attacks, also known as the **dot-dot-slash attack**, take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots ../. If the attacker finds the entry point, which in this case `get.php?file=`, then the attacker may send something as follows: `http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd`

Similarly, if the web application runs on a Windows server, the attacker needs to provide Windows paths. For example, if the attacker wants to read the boot.ini file located in `c:\boot.ini`, then the attacker can try the following depending on the target OS version:

`http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../boot.ini` or 
`http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../windows/win.ini`

### Local File Inclusion (﻿LFI) #1

LFI attacks against web applications are often due to a developers' lack of security awareness. With PHP, using functions such as `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` often contribute to vulnerable web applications.

```php
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>
```

The PHP code above uses a `GET` request via the URL parameter `lang` to include the file of the page. The call can be done by sending the following HTTP request as follows: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN.php` to load the English page or `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=AR.php` to load the Arabic page, where `EN.php` and `AR.php` files exist in the same directory.

We can access and display any readable file on the server from the code above if there isn't any input validation. Let's say we want to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains sensitive information about the users of the Linux operating system, we can try the following: `http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd` 

In this case, it works because there isn't a directory specified in the `include` function and no input validation.

```php
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>
```

In the above code, the developer decided to use the include function to call PHP pages in the languages directory only via lang parameters.  If there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the `lang` input with other OS-sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.

Again the payload looks similar to the path traversal, but the include function allows us to include any called files into the current page. The following will be the exploit: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd`

## Local File Inclusion (﻿LFI) #2

In this scenario, we have the following entry point: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN`. 
If we enter an invalid input, such as THM, we get the following error:
```php
Warning: include(languages/THM.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```
