The point wherein a web application using SQL can turn into SQL Injection is when user-provided data gets included in the SQL query.

Take the following scenario where you've come across an online blog, and each blog entry has a unique ID number. The blog entries may be either set to public or private, depending on whether they're ready for public release. The URL for each blog entry may look something like this:  
  
`https://website.thm/blog?id=1`

From the URL above, you can see that the blog entry selected comes from the id parameter in the query string. The web application needs to retrieve the article from the database and may use an SQL statement that looks something like the following:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;`

From what you've learned in the previous task, you should be able to work out that the SQL statement above is looking in the blog table for an article with the id number of 1 and the private column set to 0, which means it's able to be viewed by the public and limits the results to only one match.  
  
As was mentioned at the start of this task, SQL Injection is introduced when user input is introduced into the database query. In this instance, the id parameter from the query string is used directly in the SQL query.  
  
Let's pretend article ID 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. We could now instead call the URL:  
   
`https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--`

Which would then, in turn, produce the SQL statement:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1;`  
  
**The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment**. 

## In-Band SQLi

- **In-Band SQL Injection**
	In-Band SQL Injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band just refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.
	
- **Error-Based SQL Injection**
	This type of SQL Injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure, as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen. This can often be used to enumerate a whole database.

- **Union-Based SQL Injection**
	This type of Injection utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.

The key to discovering error-based SQL Injection is to break the code's SQL query by trying certain characters until an error message is produced; these are most commonly single apostrophes ( ' ) or a quotation mark ( " ).  

Try typing an apostrophe ( **'** ) after the id=1 and press enter. And you'll see this returns an SQL error informing you of an error in your syntax. The fact that you've received this error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability. We can now exploit this vulnerability and use the error messages to learn more about the database structure.

The first thing we need to do is return data to the browser without displaying an error message. Firstly, we'll try the UNION operator so we can receive an extra result if we choose it. Try setting the mock browsers id parameter to:
`1 UNION SELECT 1`
![[Pasted image 20240610174425.png]]

This statement should produce an error message informing you that the UNION SELECT statement has a different number of columns than the original SELECT query. So let's try again but add another column:
`1 UNION SELECT 1,2`

Same error again, so let's repeat by adding another column:
`1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3`
![[Pasted image 20240610174445.png]]

Success, the error message has gone, and the article is being displayed, but now we want to display our data instead of the article. The article is displayed because it takes the first returned result somewhere in the website's code and shows that. To get around that, we need the first query to produce no results. This can simply be done by changing the article ID from 1 to 0.
`0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3`
![[Pasted image 20240610174518.png]]

You'll now see the article is just made up of the result from the UNION select, returning the column values 1, 2, and 3. We can start using these returned values to retrieve more useful information. First, we'll get the database name that we have access to:
`0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()`
![[Pasted image 20240610174554.png]]

You'll now see where the number 3 was previously displayed; it now shows the name of the database, which is **sqli_one**. Our next query will gather a list of tables that are in this database.

`0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'sqli_one'`
![[Pasted image 20240610174714.png]]

There are a couple of new things to learn in this query. Firstly, the method **group_concat()** gets the specified column (in our case, table_name) from multiple returned rows and puts it into one string separated by commas. The next thing is the **information_schema** database; every user of the database has access to this, and it contains information about all the databases and tables the user has access to. In this particular query, we're interested in listing all the tables in the **sqli_one** database, which is article and staff_users. 

As the first level aims to discover Martin's password, the staff_users table is what interests us. We can utilise the information_schema database again to find the structure of this table using the below query.

`0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'staff_users'`
![[Pasted image 20240610174837.png]]

This is similar to the previous SQL query. However, the information we want to retrieve has changed from table_name to **column_name**, the table we are querying in the information_schema database has changed from tables to **columns**, and we're searching for any rows where the **table_name** column has a value of **staff_users**.

The query results provide three columns for the staff_users table: id, password, and username. We can use the username and password columns for our following query to retrieve the user's information.

`0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM staff_users`
![[Pasted image 20240610174947.png]]

We use the group_concat method to return all of the rows into one string and make it easier to read. We've also added **,':',** to split the username and password from each other. Instead of being separated by a comma, we've chosen the HTML '<br'> tag that forces each result to be on a separate line to make for easier reading.
