SSRF stands for Server-Side Request Forgery. It's a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing.

There are two types of SSRF vulnerability:
- regular SSRF where data is returned to the attacker's screen. 
- blind SSRF vulnerability where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen.

A successful SSRF attack can result in any of the following: 
- Access to unauthorized areas.
- Access to customer/organizational data.
- Ability to Scale to internal networks.
- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials.
