SSRF stands for Server-Side Request Forgery. It's a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing.

There are two types of SSRF vulnerability:
- regular SSRF where data is returned to the attacker's screen. 
- blind SSRF vulnerability where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen.

A successful SSRF attack can result in any of the following: 
- Access to unauthorized areas.
- Access to customer/organizational data.
- Ability to Scale to internal networks.
- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials.

**Example:**
We have the following URL: `https://website.thm/item/2?server=api`. [(1)]
We want to construct our payload in order to force the webserver to return data from `https://server.website.thm/flag?id=9`. [(2)]

The payload will be `https://website.thm/item/2?server=server.website.thm/flag?id=9&x` [(1)+(2)]. Notice the `&x` at the end of the payload thus this method ensure the URL remains properly formatted. Adding `&x` at the end of an SSRF payload can be a technique to ensure the URL format is preserved, bypass validation mechanisms, or manipulate the server's request handling.
