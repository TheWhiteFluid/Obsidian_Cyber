Nmap can be used to:
- Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports);
- Detect the OS based on any signs revealed by the target;
- Run Nmap’s traceroute;
- Run select Nmap scripts;
- Save the scan results in various formats;
## Service Detection
Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service.

Adding `-sV` to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with `--version-intensity LEVEL` where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. `-sV --version-light` has an intensity of 2, while `-sV --version-all` has an intensity of 9.

*Note:*
	It is important to note that using `-sV` will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan `-sS` is not possible when `-sV` option is chosen.

Adding the `-sV` option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of `22/tcp open ssh`, we obtain `22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0)`

```shell-session

## OS Detection and Traceroute
### OS Detection
Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using `-O`; this is an _uppercase O_ as in OS.
```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS -O 10.10.162.84

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-10 05:04 BST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.91 seconds
```

*Note:*
	The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

### Traceroute
If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add `--traceroute`

*Note:*
	Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the `traceroute` command found on Linux and macOS or `tracert` found on MS Windows. Standard `traceroute` starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.
	It is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses.

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.162.84

### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. Many programs provide additional functionality via scripts; moreover, scripts make it possible to add custom functionality that did not exist via the built-in commands.

Nmap default installation can easily contain close to 600 scripts at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`.

 You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using `--script=default` or simply adding `-sC`. In addition to [default](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/default.html), categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table:

| Script Category | Description                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`          | Authentication related scripts                                         |
| `broadcast`     | Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages                           |
| `brute`         | Performs brute-force password auditing against logins                  |
| `default`       | Default scripts, same as `-sC`                                         |
| `discovery`     | Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names |
| `dos`           | Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)                  |
| `exploit`       | Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services                        |
| `external`      | Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal   |
| `fuzzer`        | Launch fuzzing attacks                                                 |
| `intrusive`     | Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation         |
| `malware`       | Scans for backdoors                                                    |
| `safe`          | Safe scripts that won’t crash the target                               |
| `version`       | Retrieve service versions                                              |
| `vuln`          | Checks for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services              |

*Note:*
	Some scripts belong to more than one category. Moreover, some scripts launch brute-force attacks against services, while others launch DoS attacks and exploit systems. Hence, it is crucial to be careful when selecting scripts to run if you don’t want to crash services or exploit them.

The command is `sudo nmap -sS -sC MACHINE_IP`, where `-sC` will ensure that Nmap will execute the default scripts following the SYN scan. There are new details that appear below. Take a look at the SSH service at port 22; Nmap recovered all four public keys related to the running server. Consider another example, the HTTP service at port 80; Nmap retrieved the default page title.
```shell-session

You can also specify the script by name using `--script "SCRIPT-NAME"` or a pattern such as `--script "ftp*"`, which would include `ftp-brute`.

*Note:*
	You have to be careful as some scripts are pretty intrusive. Moreover, some scripts might be for a specific server and, if chosen at random, will waste your time with no benefit. As usual, make sure that you are authorised to launch such tests on the target server.\


Let’s consider a benign script, `http-date`, which we guess would retrieve the http server date and time, and this is indeed confirmed in its description: “Gets the date from HTTP-like services. Also, it prints how much the date differs from local time…”
```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sS -n --script "http-date" MACHINE_IP

*Note:*
	You might expand the functionality of Nmap beyond the official Nmap scripts; you can write your script or download Nmap scripts from the Internet. Downloading and using a Nmap script from the Internet holds a certain level of risk. So it is a good idea not to run a script from an author you don’t trust.

## Saving the Output
Whenever you run a Nmap scan, it is only reasonable to save the results in a file. Selecting and adopting a good naming convention for your filenames is also crucial. The number of files can quickly grow and hinder your ability to find a previous scan result. The three main formats are:
1. Normal
2. Grepable (`grep`able)
3. XML
