- **Robots.txt**
The robots.txt file is a document that tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results or ban specific search engines from crawling the website altogether. It can be common practice to restrict certain website areas so they aren't displayed in search engine results. These pages may be areas such as administration portals or files meant for the website's customers. This file gives us a great list of locations on the website that the owners don't want us to discover as penetration testers.

```

``` 

- **Sitemap.xml**
Unlike the robots.txt file, which restricts what search engine crawlers can look at, the sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.

  ```
  http://10.10.142.89/sitemap.xml
```
 
  - **Favicon**
  Sometimes when frameworks are used to build a website, a favicon that is part of the installation gets leftover, and if the website developer doesn't replace this with a custom one, this can give us a clue on what framework is in use. OWASP host a database of common framework icons that you can use to check against the targets favicon [https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database). Once we know the framework stack, we can use external resources to discover more about it.
  
```
user@machine$ curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
```
*PowerShell command*
```
PS C:\> curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico -UseBasicParsing -o favicon.ico 
PS C:\> Get-FileHash .\favicon.ico -Algorithm MD5
```

- ***HTTP Headers***
When we make requests to the web server, the server returns various HTTP headers. These headers can sometimes contain useful information such as the webserver software and possibly the programming/scripting language in use. Using this information, we could find vulnerable versions of software being used. Try running the below curl command against the web server, where the **-v** switch enables verbose mode, which will output the headers.

```
user@machine$ curl -v http://10.10.142.89
```

- **Framework Stack**
Once you've established the framework of a website, either from the above favicon example or by looking for clues in the page source such as comments, copyright notices or credits, you can then locate the framework's website. From there, we can learn more about the software and other information, possibly leading to more content we can discover.

- **Google Hacking / Dorking**
Google hacking / Dorking utilizes Google's advanced search engine features, which allow you to pick out custom content. You can, for instance, pick out results from a certain domain name using the **site:** filter, for example (site:[tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com/)) you can then match this up with certain search terms, say, for example, the word admin (site:tryhackme.com admin) this then would only return results from the [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com/) website which contain the word admin in its content. You can combine multiple filters as well. Here is an example of more filters you can use:

| **Filter** | **Example**        | **Description**                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| site       | site:tryhackme.com | returns results only from the specified website address      |
| inurl      | inurl:admin        | returns results that have the specified word in the URL      |
| filetype   | filetype:pdf       | returns results which are a particular file extension        |
| intitle    | intitle:admin      | returns results that contain the specified word in the title |

- **Wappalyzer**
Wappalyzer ([https://www.wappalyzer.com/](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)) is an online tool and browser extension that helps identify what technologies a website uses, such as frameworks, Content Management Systems (CMS), payment processors and much more, and it can even find version numbers as well.
