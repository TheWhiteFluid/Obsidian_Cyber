There is a myriad of tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning. Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.

## **Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research**
The vulnerability scanner [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) has both a free (community) edition and commercial.

| Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.                  | People can often become reliant on these tools.                                                                                           |
| These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.                                    | They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes. |
| Open-source solutions exist.                                                                                | Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.                                             |
| Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for. | They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.                                                                             |
