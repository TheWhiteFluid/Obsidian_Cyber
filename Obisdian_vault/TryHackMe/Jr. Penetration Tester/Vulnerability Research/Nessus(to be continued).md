Nessus uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at. Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn't make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.

Start the Nessus Service with the command:  

`sudo /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service`
