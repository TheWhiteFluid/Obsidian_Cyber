## [Severity 1] 
### **Injection**
Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are being used and how exactly the input is interpreted by these technologies. Some common examples include:
- **SQL Injection:** This occurs when user controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. 
		Access, Modify and Delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean that an attacker can steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
- **Command Injection**: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary system commands on application servers.
		Execute Arbitrary system commands on a server that would allow an attacker to gain access to users’ systems. This would enable them to steal sensitive data and carry out more attacks against infrastructure linked to the server on which the command is executed.

The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:
- Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe input or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected and the application throws an error.
- Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these characters are removed before they are processed.

*Note:*
	Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or even just stripping input, there are various libraries that perform these actions for you.

### **OS Command Injection**
Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.  It is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to take advantage of that made system call to execute operating system commands on the server.  Sometimes this won't always end in something malicious, like a `whoami` or just reading of files.  That isn't too bad.  But the thing about command injection is it opens up many options for the attacker.  The worst thing they could do would be to spawn a reverse shell to become the user that the web server is running as.

A simple `;nc -e /bin/bash` is all that's needed and they own your server; some variants of netcat don't support the -e option. You can use a list of [these](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) reverse shells as an alternative.  Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and start looking for ways to pivot around. 

- **How it Happens:**
When a web application or any software program uses user input to create and execute an OS command, there's a risk that an attacker could manipulate this input to execute unintended commands. For example, if a web application takes a filename from a user input field and appends it to a command string to delete a file on the server (`rm filename`), an attacker might enter something like `filename; ls`, which could result in the execution of two commands:
1. `rm filename` (removes the file, as intended)
2. `ls` (lists all files in the directory)

This is a simple example, but the concept extends to more dangerous commands that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or take control of the server.

- **Common Causes:**
1. **Insecure Shell Execution**: When a program uses functions like `system()`, `exec()`, or similar to run shell commands without properly sanitizing or validating inputs.
2. **Concatenating User Input**: Directly appending or injecting user input into OS command strings.
3. **Lack of Input Validation**: Not properly filtering or sanitizing inputs to ensure they don't contain special characters or sequences that could be interpreted as part of a command.

- **Example Scenario:**
Imagine a web application that allows users to check the status of a server by entering a server name:
```
import os 
server_name = input("Enter the server name: ") 
os.system(f"ping {server_name}")
```

If an attacker enters `server_name` as `example.com; rm -rf /`, the application would execute:
`ping example.com; rm -rf /`

This would first ping `example.com`, then execute the devastating command `rm -rf /`, which could delete all files on the system.

***Consequences*:**
- **Data Theft or Loss**: Attackers can steal or delete sensitive data.
- **System Takeover**: Attackers may gain control over the server, leading to further attacks.
- **Denial of Service**: By executing commands that overwhelm the system, attackers can cause the application or server to crash.

***Mitigation* *Strategies*:**
1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated, sanitized, and, if possible, constrained to a specific format or type.
2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Where possible, avoid using functions that directly execute OS commands. Use safer APIs or libraries designed to perform the necessary operations without invoking a shell.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run applications with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful injection.
4. **Escape User Inputs**: If commands must be dynamically constructed, ensure that inputs are properly escaped.
5. **Use Parameterized Functions**: Use functions that separate command and parameters, preventing the user input from being interpreted as part of the command.

#### **Active Command Injection**
- *Blind* command injection occurs when the system command made to the server does not return the response to the user in the HTML document.  
- *Active* command injection will return the response to the user.  It can be made visible through several HTML elements. 

Let's consider a scenario: EvilCorp has started development on a web based shell but has accidentally left it exposed to the Internet.  It's nowhere near finished but contains the same command injection vulnerability as before!  But this time, the response from the system call can be seen on the page:
![[Pasted image 20240808164358.png]]
1. Checking if the parameter "commandString" is set
2. If it is, then the variable `$command_string` gets what was passed into the input field
3. The program then goes into a try block to execute the function `passthru($command_string)`.  You can read the docs on `passthru()` on [PHP's website](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php), but in general, it is executing what gets entered into the input then passing the output directly back to the browser.
4. If the try does not succeed, output the error to page.  Generally this won't output anything because you can't output stderr but PHP doesn't let you have a try without a catch.

- ***Ways to Detect Active Command Injection***
	We know that active command injection occurs when you can see the response from the system call.  In the above code, the function `passthru()` is actually what's doing all of the work here.  It's passing the response directly to the document so you can see the fruits of your labor right there.  Since we know that, we can go over some useful commands to try to enumerate the machine a bit further.  The function call here to `passthru()` may not always be what's happening behind the scenes, but I felt it was the easiest and least complicated way to demonstrate the vulnerability. Commands to try:
	
		Linux
		- whoami
		- id
		- ifconfig/ip addr
		- uname -a
		- ps -ef
		
		Windows
		- whoami
		- ver
		- ipconfig
		- tasklist
		- netstat -an

## [Severity 2] 

### **Broken Authentication**
Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, the server would verify them. If they are correct, the server would then provide the users’ browser with a session cookie. A session cookie is needed because web servers use HTTP(S) to communicate which is stateless. Attaching session cookies means that the server will know who is sending what data. 
  
If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they would then successfully gain access to other users’ accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include:
- Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker is able to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts. 
- Use of weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as ‘password1’ or common passwords, then an attacker is able to easily guess them and access user accounts. They can do this without brute forcing and without multiple attempts.
- Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, an attacker can set their own session cookies and access users’ accounts.

There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:
- To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy. 
- To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute force attacks.
- Implement Multi Factor Authentication - If a user has multiple methods of authentication, for example, using username and passwords and receiving a code on their mobile device, then it would be difficult for an attacker to get access to both credentials to get access to their account.

A lot of times what happens is that developers forgets to sanitize the input(username & password) given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection. However, we are going to focus on a vulnerability that happens because of a developer's mistake but is very easy to exploit i.e re-registration of an existing user.

Let's understand this with the help of an example, say there is an existing user with the name admin and now we want to get access to their account so what we can do is try to re-register that username but with slight modification. We are going to enter `" admin"`(notice the space in the starting). Now when you enter that in the username field and enter other required information like email id or password and submit that data. It will actually register a new user but that user will have the same right as normal admin. That new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user admin.

## [Severity 3]
### **Sensitive Data Exposure** 
When a webapp accidentally divulges sensitive data, we refer to it as "Sensitive Data Exposure". This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc), but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. At more complex levels this often involves techniques such as a "Man in The Middle Attack", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device which they control, then take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to gain access to the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place...). 

#### Sqlite3 - flat database files
The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format that is easily accessible from many locations at once is in a database. In a production environment it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers, running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These databases are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer.

The most common (and simplest) format of flat-file database is an _sqlite_ database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages, and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called "_sqlite3_", and is installed by default on Kali.

To access it we use: `sqlite3 <database-name>`
To see a list of all the tables in the database, use the following command: `.tables`

## [Severity 4] 

### **XML External Entity**
An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.  
  
There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).  
1) in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
2) out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a markup language used for storing and transporting data.
	- XML is platform-independent and programming language independent, thus it can be used on any system and supports the technology change when that happens.  
	- The data stored and transported using XML can be changed at any point in time without affecting the data presentation.  
	- XML allows validation using DTD and Schema. This validation ensures that the XML document is free from any syntax error.  
	- XML simplifies data sharing between various systems because of its platform-independent nature. XML data doesn’t require any conversion when transferred between different systems.

Every XML document mostly starts with what is known as XML Prolog.  
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`

Above the line is called XML prolog and it specifies the XML version and the encoding used in the XML document. This line is not compulsory to use but it is considered a `good practice` to put that line in all your XML documents.  
  
Every XML document must contain a `ROOT` element. For example:  
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mail>
   <to>falcon</to>
   <from>feast</from>
   <subject>About XXE</subject>
   <text>Teach about XXE</text>
</mail>
```

In the above example the `<mail>` is the ROOT element of that document and `<to>`, `<from>`, `<subject>`, `<text>` are the children elements. If the XML document doesn't have any root element then it would be considered`wrong` or `invalid` XML doc.

#### DTD
DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. Say we have a file named `note.dtd` with the following content:  

`<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>`

Now we can use this DTD to validate the information of some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.
![[Pasted image 20240811015245.png]]
- !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
- !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
- !ELEMENT to - Defines the `to` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT from - Defines the `from` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the `heading` element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT body - Defines the `body` element to be of type "#PCDATA"

    NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.

#### XXE Payload
```
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY name "feast"> ]>     !!!
 <userInfo>  
  <firstName>falcon</firstName>  
  <lastName>&name;</lastName>          !!!
 </userInfo>
```

We can also use XXE to read some file from the system by defining an ENTITY and having it use the SYSTEM keyword:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>
<root>&read;</root>
```

Where is falcon's SSH key located?

## [Severity 5] 

### **Broken Access Control**
Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors, for example only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor is able to access the protected page/pages that they are not authorised to view, the access controls are broken.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages, can lead to the following:
- Being able to view sensitive information
- Accessing unauthorized functionality

OWASP have a listed a few attack scenarios demonstrating access control weaknesses:  

Scenario #1: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:
```
pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
```

An attacker simply modifies the ‘acct’ parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want. If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user’s account.
`http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct`

Scenario #2: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.
`http://example.com/app/getappInfo`
`http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo`

#### **IDOR**
