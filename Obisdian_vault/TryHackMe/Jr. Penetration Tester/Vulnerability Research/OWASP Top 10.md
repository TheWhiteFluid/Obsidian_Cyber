## [Severity 1] 
### **Injection**
Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are being used and how exactly the input is interpreted by these technologies. Some common examples include:
- **SQL Injection:** This occurs when user controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. 
		Access, Modify and Delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean that an attacker can steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
- **Command Injection**: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary system commands on application servers.
		Execute Arbitrary system commands on a server that would allow an attacker to gain access to users’ systems. This would enable them to steal sensitive data and carry out more attacks against infrastructure linked to the server on which the command is executed.

The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:
- Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe input or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected and the application throws an error.
- Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these characters are removed before they are processed.

*Note:*
	Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or even just stripping input, there are various libraries that perform these actions for you.

### **OS Command Injection**
Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.  It is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to take advantage of that made system call to execute operating system commands on the server.  Sometimes this won't always end in something malicious, like a `whoami` or just reading of files.  That isn't too bad.  But the thing about command injection is it opens up many options for the attacker.  The worst thing they could do would be to spawn a reverse shell to become the user that the web server is running as.

A simple `;nc -e /bin/bash` is all that's needed and they own your server; some variants of netcat don't support the -e option. You can use a list of [these](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) reverse shells as an alternative.  Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and start looking for ways to pivot around. 

- **How it Happens:**
When a web application or any software program uses user input to create and execute an OS command, there's a risk that an attacker could manipulate this input to execute unintended commands. For example, if a web application takes a filename from a user input field and appends it to a command string to delete a file on the server (`rm filename`), an attacker might enter something like `filename; ls`, which could result in the execution of two commands:
1. `rm filename` (removes the file, as intended)
2. `ls` (lists all files in the directory)

This is a simple example, but the concept extends to more dangerous commands that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or take control of the server.

- **Common Causes:**
1. **Insecure Shell Execution**: When a program uses functions like `system()`, `exec()`, or similar to run shell commands without properly sanitizing or validating inputs.
2. **Concatenating User Input**: Directly appending or injecting user input into OS command strings.
3. **Lack of Input Validation**: Not properly filtering or sanitizing inputs to ensure they don't contain special characters or sequences that could be interpreted as part of a command.

- **Example Scenario:**
Imagine a web application that allows users to check the status of a server by entering a server name:
```
import os server_name = input("Enter the server name: ") 
os.system(f"ping {server_name}")
```

If an attacker enters `server_name` as `example.com; rm -rf /`, the application would execute:
`ping example.com; rm -rf /`

This would first ping `example.com`, then execute the devastating command `rm -rf /`, which could delete all files on the system.

***Consequences*:**
- **Data Theft or Loss**: Attackers can steal or delete sensitive data.
- **System Takeover**: Attackers may gain control over the server, leading to further attacks.
- **Denial of Service**: By executing commands that overwhelm the system, attackers can cause the application or server to crash.

***Mitigation* *Strategies*:**
1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that all user inputs are validated, sanitized, and, if possible, constrained to a specific format or type.
2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Where possible, avoid using functions that directly execute OS commands. Use safer APIs or libraries designed to perform the necessary operations without invoking a shell.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run applications with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful injection.
4. **Escape User Inputs**: If commands must be dynamically constructed, ensure that inputs are properly escaped.
5. **Use Parameterized Functions**: Use functions that separate command and parameters, preventing the user input from being interpreted as part of the command.
