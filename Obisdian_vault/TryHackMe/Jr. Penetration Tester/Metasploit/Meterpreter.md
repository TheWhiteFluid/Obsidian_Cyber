Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands. Meterpreter has many versions which will provide different functionalities based on the target system.

## **How it works**
Meterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target. This feature aims to avoid being detected during antivirus scans. By default, most antivirus software will scan new files on the disk (e.g. when you download a file from the internet). Meterpreter runs in memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) to avoid having a file that has to be written to the disk on the target system (e.g. meterpreter.exe). This way, Meterpreter will be seen as a process and not have a file on the target system.

Meterpreter also aims to avoid being detected by network-based IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) solutions by using encrypted communication with the server where Metasploit runs (typically your attacking machine). If the target organization does not decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic (e.g. HTTPS) coming to and going out of the local network, IPS and IDS solutions will not be able to detect its activities. 

Note:
	Meterpreter ***is recognized by major antivirus software***.

## **Flavours**
Metasploit payloads can be initially divided into two categories:
- inline (also called single) 
- staged(payloads are sent to the target in two steps).

Meterpreter payloads are also divided into `stagged` and `inline` versions. However, Meterpreter has a wide range of different versions you can choose from based on your target system.

The easiest way to have an idea about available Meterpreter versions could be to list them using msfvenom, as seen below:
![[Pasted image 20240816010547.png]]\

The list will show Meterpreter versions available for the following platforms:
- Android
- Apple iOS
- Java
- Linux
- OSX
- PHP
- Python
- Windows
  
Your decision on which version of Meterpreter to use will be mostly based on three factors:
1) The target operating system (Is the target operating system Linux or Windows? Is it a Mac device? Is it an Android phone? etc.)
2) Components available on the target system (Is Python installed? Is this a PHP website? etc.)
3) Network connection types you can have with the target system (Do they allow raw TCP connections? Can you only have an HTTPS reverse connection? Are IPv6 addresses not as closely monitored as IPv4 addresses? etc.)

If you are not using Meterpreter as a standalone payload generated by Msfvenom, your choice may also be limited by the exploit. You will notice some exploits will have a default Meterpreter payload, as you can see in the example below with the `ms17_010_eternalblue` exploit.

You can also list other available payloads using the `show payloads` command with any module:

## **Commands**
Typing `help` on any Meterpreter session (shown by `meterpreter>` at the prompt) will list all available commands.
![[Pasted image 20240816012346.png]]

Every version of Meterpreter will have different command options, so running the `help` command is always a good idea. Commands are built-in tools available on Meterpreter. They will run on the target system without loading any additional script or executable files.

Meterpreter will provide you with three primary categories of tools;
- Built-in ***commands***
- Meterpreter ***tools***
- Meterpreter ***scripting***

Running `help`  you will see Meterpreter ***commands*** are listed under different categories.
- Core commands
- File system commands
- Networking commands
- System commands
- User interface commands
- Webcam commands
- Audio output commands
- Elevate commands
- Password database commands
- Timestamp commands

*Note*:
	The list above was taken from the output of the `help` command on the Windows version of Meterpreter (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp). These will be different for other Meterpreter versions.

Core commands will be helpful to navigate and interact with the target system. Below are some of the most commonly used. Remember to check all available commands running the help command once a Meterpreter session has started.

**Others** (these will be listed under different menu categories in the help menu)
- `idletime`: Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle
- `keyscan_dump`: Dumps the keystroke buffer
- `keyscan_start`: Starts capturing keystrokes
- `keyscan_stop`: Stops capturing keystrokes

- `getsystem`: Attempts to elevate your privilege to that of local system
- `hashdump`: Dumps the contents of the SAM database


## **Post-Exploitation**
Meterpreter provides you with many useful commands that facilitate the post-exploitation phase. Below are a few examples you will often use.

- **Help**:
This command will give you a list of all available commands in Meterpreter. As we have seen earlier, Meterpreter has many versions, and each version may have different options available. Typing help once you have a Meterpreter session will help you quickly browse through available commands.

- **Meterpreter commands**:
The `ps` command will list running processes. The PID column will also give you the PID information you will need to migrate Meterpreter to another process.
![[Pasted image 20240816024300.png]]

- **Migrate**:
Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the `keyscan_start`, `keyscan_stop`, and `keyscan_dump` command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.
![[Pasted image 20240816024408.png]]

*Note*:
	Be careful; you may lose your user privileges if you migrate from a higher privileged (e.g. SYSTEM) user to a process started by a lower privileged user (e.g. webserver). You may not be able to gain them back.


- **Hashdump**:
The `hashdump` command will list the content of the SAM database. The SAM (Security Account Manager) database stores user's passwords on Windows systems. These passwords are stored in the NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) format.
![[Pasted image 20240816024526.png]]

*Note*:
	While it is not mathematically possible to "crack" these hashes, you may still discover the cleartext password using online NTLM databases or a rainbow table attack. These hashes can also be used in Pass-the-Hash attacks to authenticate to other systems that these users can access the same network.


- **Search**:
The `search` command is useful to locate files with potentially juicy information. In a CTF context, this can be used to quickly find a flag or proof file, while in actual penetration testing engagements, you may need to search for user-generated files or configuration files that may contain password or account information.
![[Pasted image 20240816024702.png]]

- **Shell**
The shell command will launch a regular command-line shell on the target system. Pressing CTRL+Z will help you go back to the Meterpreter shell.

## Post-Exploitation Challenge
Commands mentioned previously, such as `getsystem` and `hashdump` will provide important leverage and information for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Meterpreter is also a good base you can use to run post-exploitation modules available on the Metasploit framework. Finally, you can also use the load command to leverage additional tools such as Kiwi or even the whole Python language.
![[Pasted image 20240816025517.png]]

The post-exploitation phase will have several goals; Meterpreter has functions that can assist all of them:
- Gathering further information about the target system.
- Looking for interesting files, user credentials, additional network interfaces, and generally interesting information on the target system.
- Privilege escalation.
- Lateral movement.

Once any additional tool is loaded using the `load` command, you will see new options on the `help` menu. The example below shows commands added for the Kiwi module (using the `load kiwi` command). These will change according to the loaded menu, so running the `help` command after loading a module is always a good idea.![[Pasted image 20240816025559.png]]
