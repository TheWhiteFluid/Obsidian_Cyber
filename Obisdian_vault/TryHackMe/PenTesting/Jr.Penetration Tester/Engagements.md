The key to a successful engagement is well-coordinated planning and communication through all parties involved. This room will focus on various components of a red team engagement and planning and documenting a campaign for a red team engagement.

Red team engagements come in many varieties; including,
- Tabletop exercises 
- Adversary emulation
- Physical assessment

The key to a successful engagement is clearly defined client objectives or goals. Client objectives should be discussed between the client and red team to create a mutual understanding between both parties of what is expected and provided. Set objectives are the basis for the rest of the engagement documentation and planning.

Engagements can be categorised between a general internal/network penetration test or a focused adversary emulation. A focused adversary emulation will define a specific APT(Advanced Persistent Threat) or group to emulate within an engagement. This will typically be determined based on groups that target the company's particular industries, i.e., finance institutions and [APT38](https://web.archive.org/web/20230325143301/https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38). An internal or network penetration test will follow a similar structure but will often be less focused and use more standard TTPs.
