The key to a successful engagement is well-coordinated planning and communication through all parties involved. This room will focus on various components of a red team engagement and planning and documenting a campaign for a red team engagement.

Red team engagements come in many varieties; including,
- Tabletop exercises 
- Adversary emulation
- Physical assessment
## **Defining Scope and Objectives**
The key to a successful engagement is clearly defined client objectives or goals. Client objectives should be discussed between the client and red team to create a mutual understanding between both parties of what is expected and provided. Set objectives are the basis for the rest of the engagement documentation and planning.

Engagements can be categorised between a general internal/network penetration test or a focused adversary emulation. A focused adversary emulation will define a specific APT(Advanced Persistent Threat) or group to emulate within an engagement. This will typically be determined based on groups that target the company's particular industries, i.e., finance institutions and [APT38](https://web.archive.org/web/20230325143301/https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38). An internal or network penetration test will follow a similar structure but will often be less focused and use more standard TTPs.

The specifics of the approach will depend on a case-by-case basis of the engagement defined by the client objectives. Client objectives will also affect the engagement's general rules of engagement and scope.

The next keystone to a precise and transparent engagement is a well-defined scope. The scope of an engagement will vary by organization and what their infrastructure and posture look like. A client's scope will typically define what you canno_t do or target; it can also include what you _can_ do or target. While client objectives can be discussed and determined along with the providing team, a scope should only be set by the client. In some cases the red team may discuss a grievance of the scope if it affects an engagement. They should have a clear understanding of their network and the implications of an assessment. The specifics of the scope and the wording will always look different, below is an example of what verbiage may look like within a client's scope.
- No exfiltration of data.
- Production servers are off-limits.
- 10.0.3.8/18 is out of scope.
- 10.0.0.8/20 is in scope.
- System downtime is not permitted under any circumstances.
- Exfiltration of PII is prohibited.

Below is an example of the client objectives of a mature organization with a strong security posture.

**Objectives:**
1. Identify system misconfigurations and network weaknesses.
    1. Focus on exterior systems.
2. Determine the effectiveness of endpoint detection and response systems.
3. Evaluate overall security posture and response.
    1. SIEM and detection measures.
    2. Remediation.
    3. Segmentation of DMZ and internal servers.
4. Use of white cards is permitted depending on downtime and length.
5. Evaluate the impact of data exposure and exfiltration.

**Scope:**
1. System downtime is not permitted under any circumstances.
    1. Any form of DDoS or DoS is prohibited.
    2. Use of any harmful malware is prohibited; this includes ransomware and other variations.
2. Exfiltration of PII is prohibited. Use arbitrary exfiltration data.
3. Attacks against systems within 10.0.4.0/22 are permitted.
4. Attacks against systems within 10.0.12.0/22 are prohibited.
5. Bean Enterprises will closely monitor interactions with the DMZ and critical/production systems.
    1. Any interaction with "*.bethechange.xyz" is prohibited.
    2. All interaction with "*.globalenterprises.thm" is permitted.
