Post-exploitation tools are used after gaining access to a system or network to maintain control, gather information, escalate privileges, or move laterally within the environment. Here are some examples of commonly used post-exploitation tools:

### 1. **Metasploit Framework**

- **Description**: Although often used for exploitation, Metasploit also includes numerous post-exploitation modules for tasks such as gathering system information, escalating privileges, and pivoting to other systems.
- **Capabilities**: Persistence, privilege escalation, collecting credentials, pivoting, etc.

### 2. **Empire**

- **Description**: A post-exploitation framework that supports PowerShell and Python agents. It's designed for stealthy operations on Windows and Unix-based systems.
- **Capabilities**: Command and control (C2), privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, etc.

### 3. **Cobalt Strike**

- **Description**: A commercial adversary simulation tool used for red teaming, which includes a robust suite of post-exploitation features.
- **Capabilities**: Beaconing (for persistence), pivoting, lateral movement, credential dumping, and more.

### 4. **Mimikatz**

- **Description**: A tool for extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory. It's widely used for post-exploitation activities in Windows environments.
- **Capabilities**: Credential dumping, Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attacks, Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) attacks, etc.

### 5. **BloodHound**

- **Description**: A tool that uses graph theory to analyze Active Directory (AD) environments, identifying paths for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
- **Capabilities**: Mapping AD relationships, identifying privilege escalation paths, lateral movement analysis, etc.

### 6. **PowerSploit**

- **Description**: A collection of PowerShell scripts designed for post-exploitation activities. It provides modules for a wide range of tasks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and persistence.
- **Capabilities**: Privilege escalation, keystroke logging, command execution, persistence, etc.

### 7. **Responder**

- **Description**: A tool for poisoning LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS responses in a local network, which allows for capturing credentials.
- **Capabilities**: Credential harvesting, man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, etc.

### 8. **LaZagne**

- **Description**: An open-source application used to retrieve passwords stored on a local machine.
- **Capabilities**: Extracting passwords from browsers, email clients, databases, etc.

### 9. **SharpHound**

- **Description**: A data collection tool for BloodHound, typically used to gather information on an Active Directory environment.
- **Capabilities**: Collecting AD data for privilege escalation and lateral movement mapping.
