Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing or divulging information by exploiting weaknesses in human nature. These "weaknesses" can be curiosity, jealously, greed and even kindness and the willingness to help someone. Phishing is a source of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information, credentials or even executing malicious code on their computer.

These emails will usually appear to come from a trusted source, whether that's a person or a business. They include content that tries to tempt or trick people into downloading software, opening attachments, or following links to a bogus website.

A term you'll come across and the type of phishing campaign a red team would participate in is **spear-phishing,** as with throwing a physical spear; you'd have a target to aim at, the same can be said with spear-phishing in that you're targeting an individual, business or organisation rather than just anybody as mass. This is an effective form of phishing for a red team engagement as they are bespoke to the target it makes them hard to detect by technology such as spam filters, antivirus and firewalls.

A red team could be contracted to solely carry out a phishing assessment to see whether a business is vulnerable to this type of attack or can also be part of a broader scale assessment and used to gain access to computer systems or services. Some other methods of phishing through other mediums are smishing which is phishing through SMS messages, and vishing which is performed through phone calls.


**Example:**  
The below example scenario shows how an employee of a company could be tricked into revealing their credentials.
1) The attacker locates the physical location of the target business.
2) The attacker then looks for nearby food suppliers and discovers a company called **Ultimate Cookies!**  
3) The Attacker registers the domain name **ultimate-cookies.thm**
4) The attacker then crafts an email to their target, tempting them with an offer of receiving some free cookies if they sign up to the website. Because the victim has heard of this local company, they are more likely to trust it.
5) The victim then follows the link in the email to the fake website created by the attacker and registers online. To keep things simple, the victim reuses the same password for all their online accounts.
6) The attacker now has the victim's email address and password and can log onto the victim's company email account. The attacker could now have access to private company information and also have somewhere to launch another phishing attack against other employees.

## **Writing Convincing Phishing Emails**
We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: 
- the sender's email address;
- the subject;
- the content;
### The Senders Address:
Ideally, the sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker. See the Choosing A Phishing Domain task below for more information on this.

To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example:
- Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to.
- Searching Google for the victim's name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands.
- Looking at the victim's business website to find suppliers.
- Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim.

### The Subject:
You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim's curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly.

Examples of this could be:
1. Your account has been compromised.
2. Your package has been dispatched/shipped.
3. Staff payroll information (do not forward!)
4. Your photos have been published.

### The Content:
If impersonating a brand or supplier, it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.) and make your content look the same as theirs, so the victim doesn't expect anything. If impersonating a contact or coworker, it could be beneficial to contact them; first, they may have some branding in their template, have a particular email signature or even something small such as how they refer to themselves, for example, someone might have the name Dorothy and their email is dorothy@company.thm. Still, in their signature, it might say "Best Regards, Dot". Learning these somewhat small things can sometimes have quite dramatic psychological effects on the victim and convince them more to open and act on the email.

If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the **[anchor text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_text)** and changing it either to some text which says "Click Here" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example:

`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">Click Here</a>`
`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">https://onlinebank.thm</a>`

## **Phishing Infrastructure**

- **Domain Name:**
You'll need to register either an authentic-looking domain name or one that mimics the identity of another domain.

- **SSL/TLS Certificates:**
Creating SSL/TLS certificates for your chosen domain name will add an extra layer of authenticity to the attack.

- **Email Server/Account:**
You'll need to either set up an email server or register with an SMTP email provider. 

- **DNS Records:**
Setting up DNS Records such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC will improve the deliverability of your emails and make sure they're getting into the inbox rather than the spam folder.

- **Web Server:**
You'll need to set up webservers or purchase web hosting from a company to host your phishing websites. Adding SSL/TLS to the websites will give them an extra layer of authenticity. 

- **Analytics:**
When a phishing campaign is part of a red team engagement, keeping analytics information is more important. You'll need something to keep track of the emails that have been sent, opened or clicked. You'll also need to combine it with information from your phishing websites for which users have supplied personal information or downloaded software.

	**GoPhish** - (Open-Source Phishing Framework) - [getgophish.com](https://getgophish.com/) 
		GoPhish is a web-based framework to make setting up phishing campaigns more straightforward. GoPhish allows you to store your SMTP server settings for sending emails, has a web-based tool for creating email templates using a simple WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. You can also schedule when emails are sent and have an analytics dashboard that shows how many emails have been sent, opened or clicked.
  
	**SET - (Social Engineering Toolkit)** - [trustedsec.com](https://www.trustedsec.com/tools/the-social-engineer-toolkit-set/)  
		The Social Engineering Toolkit contains a multitude of tools, but some of the important ones for phishing are the ability to create spear-phishing attacks and deploy fake versions of common websites to trick victims into entering their credentials.
