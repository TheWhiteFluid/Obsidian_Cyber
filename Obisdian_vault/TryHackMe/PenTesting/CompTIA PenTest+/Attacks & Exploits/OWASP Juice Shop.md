## **Injection**/.Sql injection
This task will be focusing on injection vulnerabilities. Injection vulnerabilities are quite dangerous to a company as they can potentially cause downtime and/or loss of data. Identifying injection points within a web application is usually quite simple, as most of them will return an error. There are many types of injection attacks, some of them are:

| SQL Injection     | SQL Injection is when an attacker enters a malicious or malformed query to either retrieve or tamper data from a database. And in some cases, log into accounts.                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Command Injection | Command Injection is when web applications take input or user-controlled data and run them as system commands. An attacker may tamper with this data to execute their own system commands. This can be seen in applications that perform misconfigured ping tests. |
| Email Injection   | Email injection is a security vulnerability that allows malicious users to send email messages without prior authorization by the email server. These occur when the attacker adds extra data to fields, which are not interpreted by the server correctly.        |

Similar to what we did earlier, we will now log into Bender's account! Capture the login request again, but this time we will put: bender@juice-sh.op'-- as the email.

Why don't we put the 1=1? Well, as the email address is valid (which will return true), we do not need to force it to be true. Thus we are able to use **'--** to bypass the login system. Note the **1=1** can be used when the email or username is not known or invalid.

## **Broken Authentication/.Brute force**
In this task, we will look at exploiting authentication through different flaws. When talking about flaws within authentication, we include mechanisms that are vulnerable to manipulation. These mechanisms, listed below, are what we will be exploiting. 
- Weak passwords in high privileged accounts;
- Forgotten password pages;

We have used SQL Injection to log into the Administrator account but we still don't know the password. Let's try a brute-force attack! We will once again capture a login request, but instead of sending it through the proxy, we will send it to Intruder.

	Go to Positions and then select the **Clear §** button. In the password field place two § inside the quotes. To clarify, the § § is not two sperate inputs but rather Burp’s implementation of quotations e.g. “”. The request should look like the image below.

For the payload, we will be using the `best1050.txt` from Seclists. (Which can be installed via: **apt-get install seclists**). Once the file is loaded into Burp, start the attack. You will want to filter for the request by status:
- A failed request will receive a 401 Unauthorized   ![](https://i.imgur.com/HcUs6eW.png)

- Whereas a successful request will return a 200 OK. ![](https://i.imgur.com/q5jcfIA.png)
