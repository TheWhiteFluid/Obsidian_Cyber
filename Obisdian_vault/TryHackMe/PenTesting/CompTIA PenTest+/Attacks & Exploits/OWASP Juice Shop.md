## **Injection**
This task will be focusing on injection vulnerabilities. Injection vulnerabilities are quite dangerous to a company as they can potentially cause downtime and/or loss of data. Identifying injection points within a web application is usually quite simple, as most of them will return an error. There are many types of injection attacks, some of them are:

| SQL Injection     | SQL Injection is when an attacker enters a malicious or malformed query to either retrieve or tamper data from a database. And in some cases, log into accounts.                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Command Injection | Command Injection is when web applications take input or user-controlled data and run them as system commands. An attacker may tamper with this data to execute their own system commands. This can be seen in applications that perform misconfigured ping tests. |
| Email Injection   | Email injection is a security vulnerability that allows malicious users to send email messages without prior authorization by the email server. These occur when the attacker adds extra data to fields, which are not interpreted by the server correctly.        |

Similar to what we did earlier, we will now log into Bender's account! Capture the login request again, but this time we will put: bender@juice-sh.op'-- as the email.

Why don't we put the 1=1? Well, as the email address is valid (which will return true), we do not need to force it to be true. Thus we are able to use **'--** to bypass the login system. Note the **1=1** can be used when the email or username is not known or invalid.
