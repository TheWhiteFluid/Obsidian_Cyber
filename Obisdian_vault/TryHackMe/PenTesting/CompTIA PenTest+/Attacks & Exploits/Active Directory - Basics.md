Microsoft's Active Directory is the backbone of the corporate world. It simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment. In this room, we'll take a deep dive into the essential components of Active Directory.

Picture yourself administering a small business network with only five computers and five employees. In such a tiny network, you will probably be able to configure each computer separately without a problem. You will manually log into each computer, create users for whoever will use them, and make specific configurations for each employee's accounts. If a user's computer stops working, you will probably go to their place and fix the computer on-site.

While this sounds like a very relaxed lifestyle, let's suppose your business suddenly grows and now has 157 computers and 320 different users located across four different offices. Would you still be able to manage each computer as a separate entity, manually configure policies for each of the users across the network and provide on-site support for everyone? The answer is most likely no.

To overcome these limitations, we can use a Windows domain. Simply put, a **Windows domain** is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralise the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called **Active Directory (AD)**. The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:
- **Centralised identity management:** All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.
- **Managing security policies:** You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.

**Real-World Example:**
In school/university networks, you will often be provided with a username and password that you can use on any of the computers available on campus. Your credentials are valid for all machines because whenever you input them on a machine, it will forward the authentication process back to the Active Directory, where your credentials will be checked. Thanks to Active Directory, your credentials don't need to exist in each machine and are available throughout the network.

Active Directory is also the component that allows your school/university to restrict you from accessing the control panel on your school/university machines. Policies will usually be deployed throughout the network so that you don't have administrative privileges over those computers.

## **Active Directory**
﻿The core of any Windows Domain is the **Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)**. This service acts as a catalogue that holds the information of all of the "objects" that exist on your network. Amongst the many objects supported by AD, we have:
﻿- users
﻿- groups
﻿- machines
﻿- printers
﻿- shares and many others..

﻿- **_Users_**
Users are one of the most common object types in Active Directory. Users are one of the objects known as **security principals**, meaning that they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over **resources** like files or printers. You could say that a security principal is an object that can act upon resources in the network.

Users can be used to represent two types of entities:
- **People:** users will generally represent persons in your organisation that need to access the network, like employees.
- **Services:** you can also define users to be used by services like IIS(Internet Information Services) or MSSQL. Every single service requires a user to run, but service users are different from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service.

- **_Machines_**
Machines are another type of object within Active Directory; for every computer that joins the Active Directory domain, a machine object will be created. Machines are also considered "security principals" and are assigned an account just as any regular user. This account has somewhat limited rights within the domain itself.

The machine accounts themselves are local administrators on the assigned computer, they are generally not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer itself, but as with any other account, if you have the password, you can use it to log in.

**Note:** 
	Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.

Identifying machine accounts is relatively easy. They follow a specific naming scheme. The machine account name is the computer's name followed by a dollar sign. For example, a machine named `DC01` will have a machine account called `DC01$`.

- **_Security Groups_**
If you are familiar with Windows, you probably know that you can define user groups to assign access rights to files or other resources to entire groups instead of single users. This allows for better manageability as you can add users to an existing group, and they will automatically inherit all of the group's privileges. Security groups are also considered security principals and, therefore, can have privileges over resources on the network.

Groups can have both users and machines as members. If needed, groups can include other groups as well.

Several groups are created by default in a domain that can be used to grant specific privileges to users. As an example, here are some of the most important groups in a domain:

| **Security Group** | **Description**                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain Admins      | Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs. |
| Server Operators   | Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.                                           |
| Backup Operators   | Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.                    |
| Account Operators  | Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.                                                                                    |
| Domain Users       | Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.                                                                                                        |
| Domain Computers   | Includes all existing computers in the domain.                                                                                                            |
| Domain Controllers | Includes all existing DCs on the domain.                                                                                                                  |

### Active Directory Users and Computers
To configure users, groups or machines in Active Directory, we need to log in to the Domain Controller and run "Active Directory Users and Computers" from the start menu:

		![[Pasted image 20240911165728.png]]


This will open up a window where you can see the hierarchy of users, computers and groups that exist in the domain. These objects are organised in **Organizational Units (OUs)** which are container objects that allow you to classify users and machines. OUs are mainly used to define sets of users with similar policing requirements. The people in the Sales department of your organisation are likely to have a different set of policies applied than the people in IT, for example. Keep in mind that a user can only be a part of a single OU at a time.


Checking our machine, we can see that there is already an OU called `THM` with four child OUs for the IT, Management, Marketing and Sales departments. It is very typical to see the OUs mimic the business' structure, as it allows for efficiently deploying baseline policies that apply to entire departments. Remember that while this would be the expected model most of the time, you can define OUs arbitrarily.
		![[Pasted image 20240911165925.png]]

If you open any OUs, you can see the users they contain and perform simple tasks like creating, deleting or modifying them as needed. You can also reset passwords if needed (pretty useful for the helpdesk):
		![[Pasted image 20240911170025.png]]

You probably noticed already that there are other default containers apart from the THM OU. These containers are created by Windows automatically and contain the following:
- **Builtin:** Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
- **Computers:** Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
- **Domain Controllers:** Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
- **Users:** Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
- **Managed Service Accounts:** Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.


### Security Groups vs OUs
You are probably wondering why we have both groups and OUs. While both are used to classify users and computers, their purposes are entirely different:
- ==**OUs**== are handy for ==**applying policies**== to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply two different sets of policies to a single user.
- ==**Security Groups**==, on the other hand, are used to ==**grant permissions over resources**.== For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.


## **Managing Users in AD**
Your first task as the new domain administrator is to check the existing AD OUs and users, as some recent changes have happened to the business. You have been given the following organisational chart and are expected to make changes to the AD to match it:
		![[Pasted image 20240911170909.png]]

### Deleting extra OUs and users
The first thing you should notice is that there is an additional department OU in your current AD configuration that doesn't appear in the chart. We've been told it was closed due to budget cuts and should be removed from the domain. If you try to right-click and delete the OU, you will get the following error:
			![[Pasted image 20240911170938.png]]

By default, OUs are protected against accidental deletion. To delete the OU, we need to enable the **Advanced Features** in the View menu:
		![[Pasted image 20240911171002.png]]

This will show you some additional containers and enable you to disable the accidental deletion protection. To do so, right-click the OU and go to Properties. You will find a checkbox in the Object tab to disable the protection:
		![[Pasted image 20240911171021.png]]

Note:
	After deleting the extra OU, you should notice that for some of the departments, the users in the AD don't match the ones in our organisational chart. Create and delete users as needed to match them.

### Delegation
One of the nice things you can do in AD is to give specific users some control over some OUs. This process is known as **delegation** and allows you to grant users specific privileges to perform advanced tasks on OUs without needing a Domain Administrator to step in.

One of the most common use cases for this is granting `IT support` the privileges to reset other low-privilege users' passwords. According to our organisational chart, Phillip is in charge of IT support, so we'd probably want to delegate the control of resetting passwords over the Sales, Marketing and Management OUs to him.

For this example, we will delegate control over the Sales OU to Phillip. To delegate control over an OU, you can right-click it and select **Delegate Control**:
			![[Pasted image 20240911171436.png]]

**Note:** 
	To avoid mistyping the user's name, write "phillip" and click the **Check Names** button. Windows will autocomplete the user for you.
	![[Pasted image 20240911171601.png]]

		![[Pasted image 20240911171715.png]]

While you may be tempted to go to **Active Directory Users and Computers** to try and test Phillip's new powers, he doesn't really have the privileges to open it, so you'll have to use other methods to do password resets. In this case, we will be using Powershell to do so:
		![[Pasted image 20240911173704.png]]
```shell-session
PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose

New Password: *********

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set-ADAccountPassword" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
```

Since we wouldn't want Sophie to keep on using a password we know, we can also force a password reset at the next logon with the following command:
```shell-session
PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie -Verbose

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
```

	![[Pasted image 20240911173738.png]]

## **Managing Computers in AD**
By default, all the machines that join a domain (except for the DCs) will be put in the container called "Computers". If we check our DC, we will see that some devices are already there:
		![[Pasted image 20240911173951.png]]

We can see some servers, some laptops and some PCs corresponding to the users in our network. Having all of our devices there is not the best idea since it's very likely that you want different policies for your servers and the machines that regular users use on a daily basis.

While there is no golden rule on how to organise your machines, an excellent starting point is segregating devices according to their use. In general, you'd expect to see devices divided into at least the three following categories:

**1. Workstations**
Workstations are one of the most common devices within an Active Directory domain. Each user in the domain will likely be logging into a workstation. This is the device they will use to do their work or normal browsing activities. These devices should never have a privileged user signed into them.

**2. Servers**
Servers are the second most common device within an Active Directory domain. Servers are generally used to provide services to users or other servers

**3. Domain Controllers**
Domain Controllers are the third most common device within an Active Directory domain. Domain Controllers allow you to manage the Active Directory Domain. These devices are often deemed the most sensitive devices within the network as they contain hashed passwords for all user accounts within the environment.

Since we are tidying up our AD, let's create two separate OUs for `Workstations` and `Servers` (Domain Controllers are already in an OU created by Windows). We will be creating them directly under the `thm.local` domain container. In the end, you should have the following OU structure:
		![[Pasted image 20240911174213.png]]

Now, move the personal computers and laptops to the Workstations OU and the servers to the Servers OU from the Computers container. Doing so will allow us to configure policies for each OU later.

## **Group Policies**
So far, we have organised users and computers in OUs just for the sake of it, but the main idea behind this is to be able to deploy different policies for each OU individually. That way, we can push different configurations and security baselines to users depending on their department.
