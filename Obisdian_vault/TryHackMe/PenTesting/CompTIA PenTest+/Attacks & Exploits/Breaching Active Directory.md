Active Directory (AD) is used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000 companies. If an organization's estate uses Microsoft Windows, you are almost guaranteed to find AD. Microsoft AD is the dominant suite used to manage Windows domain networks. However, since AD is used for Identity and Access Management of the entire estate, it holds the keys to the kingdom, making it a very likely target for attackers.

Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, you need initial access first. You need to acquire an initial set of valid AD credentials. Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant. 

When looking for that first set of credentials, we don't focus on the permissions associated with the account; thus, even a low-privileged account would be sufficient. We are just looking for a way to authenticate to AD, allowing us to do further enumeration on AD itself.

In this network, we will cover several methods that can be used to breach AD. This is by no means a complete list as new methods and techniques are discovered every day. However, we will  cover the following techniques to recover AD credentials in this network:
- NTLM Authenticated Services
- LDAP Bind Credentials
- Authentication Relays
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
- Configuration Files

We can use these techniques on a security assessment either by targeting systems of an organisation that are internet-facing or by implanting a rogue device on the organization's network.

- **AttackBox**  
If you are using the Web-based AttackBox, you will be connected to the network automatically if you start the AttackBox from the room's page. You can verify this by running the ping command against the IP of the THMDC.za.tryhackme.com host. We do still need to configure DNS, however. Windows Networks use the Domain Name Service (DNS) to resolve hostnames to IPs. Throughout this network, DNS will be used for the tasks. You will have to configure DNS on the host on which you are running the VPN connection. In order to configure our DNS, run the following command:
```shell-session
[thm@thm]$ systemd-resolve --interface breachad --set-dns $THMDCIP --set-domain za.tryhackme.com
```

Reminder:
	Replace $THMDCIP with the IP of THMDC in your network diagram. 

You can test that DNS is working by running: `nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com`

Note:
	Take the time to make note of your VPN IP. Using `ifconfig` or `ip a`, make note of the IP of the **breachad** network adapter. This is your IP and the associated interface that you should use when performing the attacks in the tasks.

- **Kali**
If you are using a Kali VM, Network Manager is most likely used as DNS manager. You can use GUI Menu to configure DNS:
- Network Manager -> Advanced Network Configuration -> Your Connection -> IPv4 Settings
- Set your DNS IP here to the IP for THMDC in the network diagram above  
- Add another DNS such as 1.1.1.1 or similar to ensure you still have internet access
- Run `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager` and test your DNS similar to the steps above.

### Debugging DNS
DNS will be a part of Active Directory testing whether you like it or not. This is because one of the two major AD authentication protocols, Kerberos, relies on DNS to create tickets. Tickets cannot be associated with IPs, so DNS is a must. If you are going to test AD networks on a security assessment, you will have to equip yourself with the skills required to solve DNS issues. Therefore, you usually have two options:
- You can hardcode DNS entries into your `/etc/hosts` file. While this may work well, it is infeasible when you will be testing networks that have more than 10000 hosts.
- You can spend the time required to debug the DNS issue to get it working. While this may be harder, in the long run, it will yield you better results.

Whenever you think that your DNS configuration might not be working as it should, follow these steps to do some debugging:
1. Follow the steps provided above. Make sure to follow the steps for your specific machine type.- If you use a completely different OS, you will have to do some googling to find your equivalent configuration.  
2. Run `ping <THM DC IP>` - This will verify that the network is active. If you do not get a response from the ping, it means that the network is not currently active. If your network says that it is running after you have refreshed the room page and you still get no ping response, contact THM support but simply waiting for the network timer to run out before starting the network again will fix the issue.
3. Run `nslookup tryhackme.com <THM DC IP>` - This will verify that the DNS server within the network is active, as the domain controller has this functional role. If the ping command worked but this does not, time to contact support since there is something wrong. It is also suggested to hit the network reset button.
4. Finally, run `nslookup tryhackme.com` - If you now get a different response than the one in step three, it means there is something wrong with your DNS configuration. Go back to the configuration steps at the start of the task and follow them again. A common issue seen on Kali is that the DNS entry is placed as the second one in your `/etc/resolv.conf` file. By making it the first entry, it will resolve the issue.
