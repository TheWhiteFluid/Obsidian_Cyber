Python can be the most powerful tool in your arsenal as it can be used to build almost any of the other penetration testing tools.
- Use Python to enumerate the target's subdomain
- Build a simple keylogger
- Scan the network to find target systems
- Scan any target to find the open ports
- Download files from the internet
- Crack hashes

## Prerequisites
**While Loops**
Let's begin by looking at how we structure a while loop. We can have the loop run indefinitely or (similar to an if statement) determine how many times the loop should run based on a condition.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
     print(i)
     i = i + 1
```

This while loop will run 10 times, outputting the value of the i variable each time it iterates (loops). Let's break this down:
- The i variable is set to 1
- The while statement specifies where the start of the loop should begin
- Every time it loops, it will start at the top (outputting the value of i)
- Then it goes to the next line in the loop, which increases the value of i by 1
- Then (as there is no more code for the program to execute), it goes to the top of the loop, starting the process over again
- The program will keep on looping until the value of the i variable is greater than 10

**For Loops**
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable, and are created using square brackets (see below). Let's learn through the following example:

```python
websites = ["facebook.com", "google.com", "amazon.com"]
for site in websites:
     print(site)
```

This for loop shown in the code block above, will run 3 times, outputting each website in the list. Let's break this down:
- The list variable called websites is storing 3 elements
- The loop iterates through each element, printing out the element
- The program stops looping when it's been through each element in the loop

### Functions
A function can also return a result, see the code block below:
```python
def calcCost(item):
     if(item == "sweets"):
          return 3.99
     elif (item == "oranges"):
          return 1.99
     else:
          return 0.99

spent = 10
spent = spent + calcCost("sweets")
print("You have spent:" + str(spent))
```

### Files
In Python, you can read and write from files. We've seen that in cyber security, it's common to write a script and import or export it from a file; whether that be as a way to store the output of your script or to import a list of 100's of websites from a file to enumerate. Let's dive straight into an example:
```python
f = open("file_name", "r")
print(f.read())
```

To open the file, we use the built-in open() function, and the "r" parameter stands for "read" and is used as we're reading the contents of the file. The variable has a read() method for reading the contents of the file. You can also use the readlines() method and loop over each line in the file; useful if you have a list where each item is on a new line. In the example above, the file is in the same folder as the Python script; if it were elsewhere, you would need to specify the full path of the file.

You can also create and write files. If you're writing to an existing file, you open the file first and use the "a" in the open function after the filename call (which stands for append). If you're writing to a new file, you use "w" (write) instead of "a". See the examples below for clarity:
```python
f = open("demofile1.txt", "a") # Append to an existing file
f.write("The file will include more text..")
f.close()

f = open("demofile2.txt", "w") # Creating and writing to a new file
f.write("demofile2 file created, with this content in!")
f.close()
```

Notice we use the close() method after writing to a file; this closes the file so no more writing to the file (within the program) can occur.

### Imports
In Python, we can import libraries, which are a collection of files that contain functions. Think of importing a library as importing functions you can use that have been already written for you. For example, there is a "date" library that gives you access to hundreds of different functions for anything date and time-related.
```python
import datetime
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print(current_time)
```

Here are some popular libraries you may find useful in scripting as a pentester:
- Request - simple HTTP library.
- [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) - send, sniff, dissect and forge network packets
- [Pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) - a CTF & exploit development library.

To install the "scapy" library (which allows you to craft your own packets in code and send them to other machines); you install it first by running the command `pip install scapy`, after which in your program you can now import the scapy library.
