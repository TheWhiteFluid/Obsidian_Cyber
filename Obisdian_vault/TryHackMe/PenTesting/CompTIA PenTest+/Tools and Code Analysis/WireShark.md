Wireshark is an open-source, cross-platform network packet analyser tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP). It is commonly used as one of the best packet analysis tools.

## **Overview**
Wireshark is one of the most potent traffic analyser tools available in the wild. There are multiple purposes for its use:  

- Detecting and troubleshooting network problems, such as network load failure points and congestion.
- Detecting security anomalies, such as rogue hosts, abnormal port usage, and suspicious traffic.
- Investigating and learning protocol details, such as response codes and payload data.

*Note:*
	Wireshark is not an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It only allows analysts to discover and investigate the packets in depth. It also doesn't modify packets; it reads them. Hence, detecting any anomaly or network problem highly relies on the analyst's knowledge and investigation skills.

### GUI and Data
	![[Pasted image 20240903231700.png]]

| **Toolbar**                       | The main toolbar contains multiple menus and shortcuts for packet sniffing and processing, including filtering, sorting, summarising, exporting and merging.                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Display Filter Bar**            | The main query and filtering section.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Recent Files**                  | List of the recently investigated files. You can recall listed files with a double-click.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Capture Filter and Interfaces** | Capture filters and available sniffing points (network interfaces).  The network interface is the connection point between a computer and a network. The software connection (e.g., lo, eth0 and ens33) enables networking hardware. |
| **Status Bar**                    | Tool status, profile and numeric packet information.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Loading PCAP Files
The above picture shows Wireshark's empty interface. The only available information is the recently processed  "http1.cap" file. Let's load that file and see Wireshark's detailed packet presentation. Note that you can also use the **"File"** menu, dragging and dropping the file, or double-clicking on the file to load a pcap.
	![[Pasted image 20240903232115.png]]

| Packet List Pane    | Summary of each packet (source and destination addresses, protocol, and packet info). You can click on the list to choose a packet for further investigation. Once you select a packet, the details will appear in the other panels. |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Packet Details Pane | Detailed protocol breakdown of the selected packet.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Packet Bytes Pane   | Hex and decoded ASCII representation of the selected packet. It highlights the packet field depending on the clicked section in the details pane.                                                                                    |

### Coloring Packets  
Along with quick packet information, Wireshark also colour packets in order of different conditions and the protocol to spot anomalies and protocols in captures quickly (this explains why almost everything is green in the given screenshots). This glance at packet information can help track down exactly what you're looking for during analysis. You can create custom colour rules to spot events of interest by using display filters, and we will cover them in the next room. Now let's focus on the defaults and understand how to view and use the represented data details.

Wireshark has two types of packet colouring methods: temporary rules that are only available during a program session and permanent rules that are saved under the preference file (profile) and available for the next program session. You can use the "right-click menu" or "`View --> Coloring Rules`" menu to create permanent colouring rules. The "`Colourise Packet List`" menu activates/deactivates the colouring rules. Temporary packet colouring is done with the "right-click menu" or "`View --> Conversation Filter"` menu.

### Traffic Sniffing  
You can use the blue **"shark button"** to start network sniffing (capturing traffic), the red button will stop the sniffing, and the green button will restart the sniffing process. The status bar will also provide the used sniffing interface and the number of collected packets.

### Merge PCAP Files  
Wireshark can combine two pcap files into one single file. You can use the **"File --> Merge"** menu path to merge a pcap with the processed one. When you choose the second file, Wireshark will show the total number of packets in the selected file. Once you click "open", it will merge the existing pcap file with the chosen one and create a new pcap file. Note that you need to save the "merged" pcap file before working on it.
	![[Pasted image 20240903233221.png]]

### View File Details
Knowing the file details is helpful. Especially when working with multiple pcap files, sometimes you will need to know and recall the file details (`File hash`, capture time, capture file comments, interface and statistics) to identify the file, classify and prioritise it. You can view the details by following "**Statistics --> Capture File Properties"** or by clicking the **"pcap icon located on the left bottom"** of the window.
	![[Pasted image 20240903235305.png]]

## **Packet Dissection**
Packet dissection is also known as protocol dissection, which investigates packet details by decoding available protocols and fields. Wireshark supports a long list of protocols for dissection, and you can also write your dissection scripts. You can find more details on dissection [**here**](https://github.com/boundary/wireshark/blob/master/doc/README.dissector).

### Packet Details
You can click on a packet in the packet list pane to open its details (double-click will open details in a new window). Packets consist of 5 to 7 layers based on the OSI model. We will go over all of them in an HTTP packet from a sample capture. The picture below shows viewing packet number 27.
	![[Pasted image 20240904015121.png]]

Each time you click a detail, it will highlight the corresponding part in the packet bytes pane.
	![[Pasted image 20240904015144.png]]

Let's have a closer view of the details pane.  

![Wireshark - packet details](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/22a21052465fedc91fc4d1ec3beb6bd6.png)  

We can see seven distinct layers to the packet: frame/packet, source [MAC], source [IP], protocol, protocol errors, application protocol, and application data. Below we will go over the layers in more detail.

**The Frame (Layer 1):** This will show you what frame/packet you are looking at and details specific to the Physical layer of the OSI model.
	![Wireshark - layer 1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/9d23e2081fa68e7d6f602aa8b0d316d9.png)  

**Source [MAC] (Layer 2):** This will show you the source and destination MAC Addresses; from the Data Link layer of the OSI model.
	![Wireshark - layer 2](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/cd06b372ae6338348ff521afb4c7243f.png)  

**Source [IP] (Layer 3):** This will show you the source and destination IPv4 Addresses; from the Network layer of the OSI model.
	![Wireshark - layer 3](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/d71eb4efc8d48a968a3e078045bd1511.png)  

**Protocol (Layer 4):** This will show you details of the protocol used (UDP/TCP) and source and destination ports; from the Transport layer of the OSI model.
	![Wireshark - layer 4](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/c373f8492470524a8f01fded43856a27.png)

**Protocol Errors:** This continuation of the 4th layer shows specific segments from TCP that needed to be reassembled.
	![Wireshark - protocol error](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/23bbe6ae6e8168cd0662998ff444b067.png)  


**Application Protocol (Layer 5):** This will show details specific to the protocol used, such as HTTP, FTP,  and SMB. From the Application layer of the OSI model.
	![Wireshark - layer 5](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/879aea2816018d27769fc8490e4af51b.png)

**Application Data:** This extension of the 5th layer can show the application-specific data.
	![Wireshark - application data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/c2d9c3ce498c6f9044413b68df287c14.png)

## **Packet Navigation**

### Packet Numbers
Wireshark calculates the number of investigated packets and assigns a unique number for each packet. This helps the analysis process for big captures and makes it easy to go back to a specific point of an event.
	![[Pasted image 20240904021652.png]]

## Go to Packet
Packet numbers do not only help to count the total number of packets or make it easier to find/investigate specific packets. This feature not only navigates between packets up and down; it also provides in-frame packet tracking and finds the next packet in the particular part of the conversation. You can use the **"Go"** menu and toolbar to view specific packets.
	![[Pasted image 20240904021727.png]]

### Find Packets
Apart from packet number, Wireshark can find packets by packet content. You can use the **"Edit --> Find Packet"** menu to make a search inside the packets for a particular event of interest. This helps analysts and administrators to find specific intrusion patterns or failure traces.

There are two crucial points in finding packets. The first is knowing the input type. This functionality accepts four types of inputs (Display filter, Hex, String and Regex). String and regex searches are the most commonly used search types. Searches are case insensitive, but you can set the case sensitivity in your search by clicking the radio button.

The second point is choosing the search field. You can conduct searches in the three panes (packet list, packet details, and packet bytes), and it is important to know the available information in each pane to find the event of interest. For example, if you try to find the information available in the packet details pane and conduct the search in the packet list pane, Wireshark won't find it even if it exists.
	![[Pasted image 20240904021850.png]]

### Mark Packets
Marking packets is another helpful functionality for analysts. You can find/point to a specific packet for further investigation by marking it. It helps analysts point to an event of interest or export particular packets from the capture. You can use the "Edit" or the "right-click" menu to mark/unmark packets.

Marked packets will be shown in black regardless of the original colour representing the connection type. Note that marked packet information is renewed every file session, so marked packets will be lost after closing the capture file.
	![[Pasted image 20240904021915.png]]

### Packet Comments
Similar to packet marking, commenting is another helpful feature for analysts. You can add comments for particular packets that will help the further investigation or remind and point out important/suspicious points for other layer analysts. Unlike packet marking, the comments can stay within the capture file until the operator removes them.
	![[Pasted image 20240904022025.png]]

### Export Packets
Capture files can contain thousands of packets in a single file. As mentioned earlier, Wireshark is not an IDS, so sometimes, it is necessary to separate specific packages from the file and dig deeper to resolve an incident. This functionality helps analysts share the only suspicious packages (decided scope). Thus redundant information is not included in the analysis process. You can use the **"File"** menu to export packets.
	![[Pasted image 20240904022114.png]]

## Export Objects (Files)
Wireshark can extract files transferred through the wire. For a security analyst, it is vital to discover shared files and save them for further investigation. Exporting objects are available only for selected protocol's streams (DICOM, HTTP, IMF, SMB and TFTP).
	![[Pasted image 20240904022147.png]]

  
## Time Display Format
Wireshark lists the packets as they are captured, so investigating the default flow is not always the best option. By default, Wireshark shows the time in "Seconds Since Beginning of Capture", the common usage is using the UTC Time Display Format for a better view. You can use the "View --> Time Display Format" menu to change the time display format.
	![[Pasted image 20240904022221.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240904022227.png]]

## Expert Info  
Wireshark also detects specific states of protocols to help analysts easily spot possible anomalies and problems. Note that these are only suggestions, and there is always a chance of having false positives/negatives. Expert info can provide a group of categories in three different severities. Details are shown in the table below.

| **Severity** | **Colour** | **Info**                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat**     | **Blue**   | Information on usual workflow.                           |
| **Note**     | **Cyan**   | Notable events like application error codes.             |
| **Warn**     | **Yellow** | Warnings like unusual error codes or problem statements. |
| **Error**    | **Red**    | Problems like malformed packets.                         |

| **Group**    | **Info**                  | **Group**      | **Info**                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Checksum** | Checksum errors.          | **Deprecated** | Deprecated protocol usage.  |
| **Comment**  | Packet comment detection. | **Malformed**  | Malformed packet detection. |

You can use the **"lower left bottom section"** in the status bar or **"Analyse --> Expert Information"** menu to view all available information entries via a dialogue box. It will show the packet number, summary, group protocol and total occurrence.
