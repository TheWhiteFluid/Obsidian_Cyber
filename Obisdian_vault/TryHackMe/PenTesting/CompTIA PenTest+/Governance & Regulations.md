Cyber security is a rapidly evolving landscape wherein malicious actors relentlessly endeavour to exploit vulnerabilities in highly-sensitive systems, often with the intent of causing severe damage, disruption, and stealing of sensitive corporate data. To combat this evolving threat, a comprehensive approach to **information security governance & regulation** is necessary. Such an approach requires establishing robust policies and guidelines and implementing rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. By adopting a proactive and strategic stance towards cyber security, organisations can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors and safeguard their sensitive systems against potentially catastrophic breaches.

## **Important Terminologies**

***GOVERNANCE***: Managing and directing an organisation or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
	Information security governance represents an organisation's established structure, policies, methods, and guidelines designed to guarantee the privacy, reliability, and accessibility of its information assets. Given the escalating complexity of cyber threats, the significance of information security governance is continually growing. It is essential for risk management, safeguarding confidential data from unauthorised intrusion, and adhering to pertinent regulations. Information security governance falls under the purview of top-tier management and includes the following processes:  
![What are the processes of information security governance](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/48120d5b5fc7d9cb7e283b8956e6a666.png)

- **Strategy**: Developing and implementing a comprehensive information security strategy that aligns with the organisation's overall business objectives.
- **Policies and procedures**: Preparing policies and procedures that govern the use and protection of information assets.
- **Risk management**: Conduct risk assessments to identify potential threats to the organisation's information assets and implement risk mitigation measures.
- **Performance measurement**: Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the information security governance program.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.


**REGULATION**: A rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm.
	Governance and regulation are closely linked in the information security paradigm but have distinct meanings. Information security regulation refers to legal and regulatory frameworks that govern the use and protection of information assets. Regulations are designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft, and misuse. Compliance with regulations is typically mandatory and enforced by government agencies or other regulatory bodies. Examples of information security regulations/standards include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and many more.

- **More Robust Security Posture**: Implementing a comprehensive security governance program and complying with relevant regulations can help an organisation reduce the risk of security breaches and protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, theft, and misuse.
- **Increased Stakeholder Confidence**: Effective security governance and regulation can enhance stakeholder trust by demonstrating that an organisation takes cyber security seriously and has implemented measures to protect sensitive data.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, can help organisations avoid legal and financial penalties and reputational damage resulting from non-compliance.
- **Better alignment with business objectives**: Security governance frameworks can help organisations align their information security strategies with their overall business objectives and ensure that security measures are cost-effective and contribute to the organisation's success.
- **Informed decision-making**: Security governance programs can provide decision-makers with the knowledge they need to make sophisticated decisions about information security risks and ensure that security measures are implemented where they are most needed.
- **Competitive advantage**: Effective security governance and compliance with relevant regulations can provide a competitive advantage by demonstrating an organisation's commitment to protecting sensitive data and enhancing stakeholder trust.


**COMPLIANCE**: The state of adhering to laws, regulations, and standards that apply to an organisation or system.

## **Frameworks**
The information security framework provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation. This mainly includes:

- **Policies**: A formal statement that outlines an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives.
- **Standards**: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service.
- **Guidelines**: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives.
- **Procedures**: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process.
- **Baselines**: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet.

### Developing Governance Documents
- **Identify the scope and purpose**:  Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.
- **Research and review**: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.
- **Draft the document**: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisation's goals and values.
- **Review and approval**: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders.
- **Implementation and communication**: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed.
- **Review and update**: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

### Real-world Scenario

***Preparing a Password Policy:***
- **Define password requirements**: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
- **Define password usage guidelines**: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.
- **Define password storage and transmission guidelines**: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission.
- **Define password change and reset guidelines**: How often passwords should be changed etc. 
- **Communicate the policy**: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy.
- **Monitor compliance**: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.

***Making an Incident Response Procedure:***
- **Define incident types**: Unauthorised access, malware infections, or data breaches.
- **Define incident response roles and responsibilities**: Identify the stakeholders,  such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. 
- **Detailed Steps**: Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident,  including initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations.
- **Report** the incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference.  
- **Communicate** the incident response procedures.
- **Review** and update the incident response procedures.

*Note:*
	Organisations only sometimes need to make a standard, frameworks, or baselines; instead, they follow and use already made documents related to their field or discipline, as the financial sector may follow PCI-DSS and GLBA; healthcare may follow HIPPA, etc. There are numerous factors upon which we decide which standard framework of baseline checklist should be used; these include regulatory requirements primarily related to the particular geographical areas, scope, objectives, available resources, and many more.

## **Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)**
As we have studied, information security governance and compliance are necessary to maintain any organisation's overall security posture. But how to achieve it? Here comes the role of the Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) framework. It focuses on steering the organisation's overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance in an integrated manner. It is a holistic approach to information security that aligns with the organisation's goals and objectives and helps to ensure that the organisation operates within the boundaries of relevant regulations and industry standards. GRC framework has the following three components:

- **Governance Component**: Involves guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy,  which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks, etc., along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes.
- **Risk Management Component**: Involves identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. This includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.
- **Compliance Component**: Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders.

### How to Develop GRC Program - Generic Guidelines
A well-developed and implemented GRC program for cyber security provides an integrated framework for managing risks, complying with regulations and standards, and improving the overall security perspective of an organisation. It enables effective governance, risk management, and compliance activities, mitigating cyber incidents' impact and ensuring business resilience. In this section, we will explore how to develop and implement a GRC framework. Developing and implementing a GRC framework involves various steps:

- **Define the scope and objectives**: This step involves determining the scope of the GRC program and defining its goals. For example, a company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system. The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining the trust of its customers. 
- **Conduct a risk assessment**: In this step, the organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. For example, a risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software. The organisation can then prioritise these risks and develop a risk management strategy.
- **Develop policies and procedures**: Policies and procedures are developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation. For example, the company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords. They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity.
- **Establish governance processes**: Governance processes ensure the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled. For example, the organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities. Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program.
- **Implement controls**: Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in risk assessment. For example, the company might implement firewalls, [Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)](https://tryhackme.com/room/idsevasion), [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](https://tryhackme.com/room/redteamnetsec), and [Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtosiem) to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error.
- **Monitor and measure performance**: Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program. For example, the organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies. This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed.
- **Continuously improve**: The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback. For example, suppose the organisation experiences a security incident. In that case, it might conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and make changes to prevent a similar incident from happening again.

### Example - GRC Framework in Financial Sector
- **Governance-Related Activities:** Nominate the governance level executives, and make financial-related policies such as bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering policy, financial audit policies, financial reporting, crisis management, and many more.
- **Risk Management Activities:** Identify potential risks, their possible outcomes, and countermeasures such as financial fraud risks, fraudulent transactions through cyber-attack, stolen credentials through phishing, fake ATM cards, etc.
- **Compliance Activities:** Take measures to meet legal requirements and industry standards such as PCI DSS, GLBA, etc. Moreover, this also includes implementing correct methods like SSL/ TLS to avoid Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring automatic patch management against unpatched software, creating awareness campaigns for users to protect them from phishing attacks, and many more.

## **Privacy and Data Protection**
In every sector, such as financial, healthcare, government, and industry, privacy and data protection regulations are critical as they deal with citizens' Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Privacy regulations help ensure individuals' personal information is handled and stored responsibly and ethically. They also help to establish trust, protect personal information, and maintain regulatory compliance. Moving forward, we will go through essential cardinals of the most important privacy and data protection regulations and their purpose, which will help us to understand why data protection regulations are crucial.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is a data protection law implemented by the EU in May 2018 to protect personal data. Personal data is "_Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly_". Key points of the law include the following:

-  **Prior approval** must be obtained before collecting any personal data.
-  Personal data should be kept to a **minimum** and only collected when necessary.
-  **Adequate measures** are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.
	![[Pasted image 20240829165044.png]]

Companies can only collect personal data for a legitimate reason and must inform the owner about its processing. Moreover, this also includes penalties and fines based on non-compliance in the following two tiers:  

- **Tier 1:** More severe violations, including unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organisation's revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is higher).
- **Tier 2**: Less severe violations, including data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organisation's revenue or 10 million euros (whichever is higher).

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) is focused on maintaining secure card transactions and protecting against data theft and fraud. It is widely used by businesses, primarily online, for card-based transactions. It was established by major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard & American Express). It requires strict control access to cardholder information and monitoring unauthorised access, using recommended measures such as web application firewalls and encryption. You can learn more about the standard [here](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Supporting%20Document/PCI_DSS-QRG-v4_0.pdf).
