Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now an important factor for keeping our online and offline activities safe from threat actors. From banking and healthcare to corporate IT, these industries rely heavily on MFA to secure data from attackers.

### MFA in Banking
Banks handle incredibly sensitive information and transactions every single day. By using MFA, banks can protect users' personal and financial information from cyber theft, fraud, and other online threats.

Typically, banks ask you to enter a password (something you know) before moving on to a second layer of security, which is a code sent via SMS or generated by an app on your phone (something you have). This way, even if someone gets hold of your password, they still need that extra bit of info to access your account or complete a transaction.

### MFA in Healthcare
In healthcare, due to regulations like [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) in the US, MFA makes sure that patient records and personal health information are only accessible by authorized persons.

For example, to access sensitive systems like electronic health records (EHRs), healthcare providers might require a doctor to use a security badge (something they have) and a fingerprint scan (something they are). This ensures that only those with the right credentials can view or alter patient data.

### MFA in Corporate IT
With the increasing number of cyber attacks and data breaches, IT departments in the corporate world are under intense pressure to protect sensitive business data and maintain system integrity. MFA helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access that could lead to data theft, espionage, or sabotage.

In a corporate setting, MFA is typically used when accessing company networks, databases, and cloud services. Employees might first log in with their corporate credentials (something they know) and then verify their identity with a code sent to their company-issued phone (something they have) or through biometric verification (something they are). This way, even if someone tries to attack their system, they’ll hit a roadblock without the second factor.
